# Complete Code and Realism Review

This directory is the tracked evidence package for the complete EvidenceForge code and
realism review frozen at `dev` commit `0a035e97d94cd2a35ebd1498cc4e133336fe14a4`.

## Review status

| Phase | Status | Primary artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline freeze | Complete | `review-baseline.json` |
| Architecture and object-model gate | Accepted 2026-08-05 | `architecture-object-model.md` |
| Event/context path census | Complete | `event-context-path-census.md` |
| Cross-cutting audits | Complete | `source-references.json`, `findings.json` |
| Empirical campaign | Complete with documented limitations | `empirical-results.json`, `probe-*.json` |
| Blind expert review | Complete | `blind-summary.md`, four individual reports |
| Security review | Complete; all findings remediated and deferred capacity item closed in Batch 6 | `security-review.md` |
| Final synthesis and remediation roadmap | Complete | `final-report.md` |
| Contract proposal approval | Approved with amendments 2026-08-05 | `contract-proposals.md` |
| Remediation Batches 0–6 | Complete | `batch3-results.json` through `batch6-results.json`, linked worklogs |
| Remediation Batch 7a | Complete | `batch7-results.json` |
| Remediation Batch 7b | Complete; post-migration effectiveness gate blocked | `batch7b-results.json`, `post-batch7b-effectiveness/REPORT.md` |

The review paused after the architecture assessment and resumed after user acceptance. No
generator fix, public API change, schema migration, or version bump was made during the campaign.

The canonical contracts were approved with amendments on 2026-08-05. Implementation is authorized
only as bounded, separately reviewed feature-branch batches.

## Package contents

- `architecture-object-model.md`: actual architecture, ownership assessment, object-model audit,
  architecture findings, target architecture, and migration order.
- `event-context-path-census.md`: reviewed path analysis and parallel-path conclusions.
- `path-classifications.json`: grouped review decisions merged into every matrix row.
- `event-context-paths.json`: exhaustive machine-readable path census.
- `coverage-summary.json`: completeness accounting for event, context, plan, bundle, emitter, and
  evaluator coverage.
- `source-references.json`: official/public source-native reference ledger for all 23 formats.
- `empirical-results.json`: reproducible scenario, profile, parser, stress, and invariant results.
- `batch3-results.json`: reproducible post-review evidence for the network/protocol/IDS remediation
  slice, including old/new probe counts, deterministic hashes, and validation gates.
- `batch4-results.json`: reproducible post-review evidence for typed world capabilities and
  lifecycle/scoped distribution state, including empirical distributions and validation gates.
- `batch5-results.json`: parent-equivalence, authored-intent reconciliation, known-bad evaluator,
  observation-profile, source-native projection, and validation evidence for Batch 5.
- `batch6-results.json`: duplicate-input, safe-path, workload, seed, parser-capacity, archive, and
  fixture-validation evidence for Batch 6.
- `batch7-results.json`: dispatch-admission, canonical-time, NAT-view, dead-alias, refreshed-census,
  rendered-equivalence, retained-migration, and documentation evidence for Batch 7a.
- `batch7b-results.json`: direct canonical-occurrence migration, ground-truth v2, deterministic
  semantic identity, and duration-stable indexed-state evidence for Batch 7b.
- `post-batch7b-effectiveness/`: one-pass automated and isolated blind-panel effectiveness
  measurement, controlled Batch 7a comparison, five-checkpoint dashboard, and release-blocker
  disposition. No follow-up blind-review fix loop was performed.
- `evaluator-capacity-results.json`: bounded retained-record RSS measurements supporting the
  evaluator's default capacity contract.
- `probe-*.json`: durable results from the generated-output invariant probe.
- `blind-*.md` and `historical-blind-evidence.json`: isolated current expert reviews and separately
  labeled historical recurrence evidence.
- `post-gate-loop5-blind/`: final isolated post-Batch-2 gate panel, scores, and verified finding
  dispositions after the five bounded lifecycle/module repair loops.
- `security-review.md`: sealed security-scan summary, threat model, findings, and limitations.
- `findings.json`: normalized 34-row validated finding register.
- `contract-proposals.md`: proposal-only canonical contracts behind a separate approval gate.
- `final-report.md`: final synthesis and dependency-ordered remediation roadmap.

Generated datasets and temporary probe outputs remain untracked. Commands, inputs, hashes, output
locations, failures, and limitations are recorded in the focused worklog at
`docs/worklog/2026-08-05-complete-realism-review.md`.
