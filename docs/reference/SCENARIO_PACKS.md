# Scenario 2.0 and composable packs

Scenario 2.0 can compose reusable industry or organization data while preserving monolithic
authoring. Packs are optional: Scenario 1.0 and Scenario 2.0 without `composition` do not discover
packs and do not warn about their absence.

Use packs for reusable, versioned context. Keep an exercise's time window, storyline, red
herrings, output, collection choices, and other run-specific fields in its scenario. The complete
pack field and validation contract is in the
[Pack Authoring Reference](../../commands/eforge/references/pack-reference.md).

## Choose the right authoring layer

| Layer | Use it for | Do not use it for |
|---|---|---|
| Industry pack | Reusable sector personas, processes, applications, destinations, traffic, and SMB storage vocabulary | Concrete users, hosts, topology, or one exercise |
| Organization pack | Exactly pinned industries, organization-specific catalogs, concrete environment, and baseline activity | Storylines, time/output settings, or runtime policy |
| Scenario | Exercise identity, seed, time, output, storyline, red herrings, and scenario-local additions/overrides | Content that should be shared and independently versioned |
| `.eforge/config` overlay | Project-wide tuning of EvidenceForge's internal configuration families | A portable public pack contract or scenario selection |

Packs cannot set safety, OOB authorization, credentials, resource policy, evaluation rules, output
policy, or engine runtime policy.

## Scenario forms

A monolithic Scenario 2.0 file replaces the legacy top-level `version` field with
`scenario_version` and otherwise uses the canonical scenario fields:

```yaml
scenario_version: "2.0"
name: monolithic-example
description: "No packs are required."
environment: ...
time_window: ...
baseline_activity: ...
output: ...
```

Select direct industry packs:

```yaml
scenario_version: "2.0"
composition:
  industries:
    - source: package
      name: healthcare
      version: "1.0.0"
name: healthcare-example
# Supply the concrete environment, time window, output, and optional storyline here.
```

Or select one organization pack, which brings its lock-selected industry dependencies:

```yaml
scenario_version: "2.0"
composition:
  organization:
    source: package
    name: northstar-health
    version: "1.0.0"
name: northstar-baseline
time_window: ...
output: ...
```

Direct industries and an organization are mutually exclusive. Persisted references always contain
an exact source, publisher, name, and `X.Y.Z` version; EvidenceForge never selects an implicit latest version.
`source` is `package`, `project`, or `path`. A path reference also contains `path`:

```yaml
source: path
path: ../packs/custom-healthcare
name: custom-healthcare
version: "1.0.0"
```

The path is relative to the YAML file that declares the reference, including when composition came
from an include. The referenced manifest name and version must match the persisted values.

## Repositories and project roots

EvidenceForge resolves whole packs from three sources:

```text
package  <installed-config-root>/packs/<type>/<name>/<version>/
project  <project-root>/.eforge/packs/<type>/<name>/<version>/
path     an explicitly named external directory
```

Installed package packs are read-only. Project packs are editable. A path pack is used only when a
scenario or command explicitly names it. There is no implicit user-global pack registry.

Scenario compilation and pack-management commands use the current working directory as their
implicit project root. `--project-root` is an explicit override only. EvidenceForge never searches
scenario ancestors, working-directory ancestors, home directories, installed packages, or source
trees for `.eforge`; a scenario elsewhere cannot select a neighboring project pack. Authoritative
resolved scenarios are self-contained and independent of project-root selection.

The selected project root does not need to contain `.eforge`. An empty directory is a valid root:
installed package packs remain available, and the project pack/config layers are simply absent
until created.

## Fixed pack contract

Every pack contains `pack.yaml` and all six catalog files, including unused catalogs:

```text
pack.yaml
catalogs/persona_catalog.yaml       # persona_catalog
catalogs/process_catalog.yaml       # process_catalog
catalogs/application_catalog.yaml   # application_catalog
catalogs/destination_catalog.yaml   # destination_catalog
catalogs/traffic_catalog.yaml       # traffic_catalog
catalogs/storage_catalog.yaml       # storage_catalog
```

Organization packs additionally contain:

```text
model/environment.yaml              # environment
model/baseline_activity.yaml        # baseline_activity
```

Each unused catalog remains present with an empty predictable root, such as
`application_catalog: {}`. This lets authors and tools predict every available filename and root
key across all packs.

A pack manifest identifies its public contract and compatibility:

```yaml
pack_schema_version: "2.0"
type: industry
publisher: evidenceforge
publisher_display_name: "EvidenceForge Official"
name: healthcare
version: "1.0.0"
requires_evidenceforge: ">=2.0.0,<3.0.0"
description: "Reusable fictional healthcare behavior and vocabulary."
industry_dependencies: []
```

Only organization packs may declare `industry_dependencies`. Every dependency declares its
source, publisher, `type: industry`, name, and version constraint. `pack.lock.yaml` alone owns the
selected exact version and digest. Industry packs cannot depend on other industries.

Pack-local IDs become public qualified IDs in the form `<publisher>/<pack-name>:<local-id>`. For example,
`healthcare` local persona `clinical-coordinator` becomes
`evidenceforge/healthcare:clinical-coordinator`. Inside the same pack, references may use local IDs; an
organization must use qualified references to dependency exports. Built-in and scenario-local
names retain their existing shorthand for monolithic compatibility.

## Catalogs and runtime behavior

The catalogs are a stable public API rather than copies of internal configuration files:

| Catalog | Defines | Generation effect |
|---|---|---|
| Persona | Reusable behavioral roles | Work hours, risk, intensity, and application eligibility |
| Process | Built-in/custom executable profiles and scoped document terms | Process images, commands, metadata, and selection |
| Application | Persona audience, process profiles, and named connections | Exact eligible process and connection graph |
| Destination | Synthetic endpoints, tags, and typed services | DNS ownership and destination IP/port/protocol |
| Traffic | Application activity, structured cadence, and low-level outbound traffic | Deterministic baseline timing and network activity |
| Storage | Bounded directory, subject, and file-type vocabulary | SMB share population and activity presets |

Persona entries use the canonical persona shape. The other five catalogs use a stable
`description` plus typed `data` envelope. Unknown keys are rejected.

Application-owned traffic forms a closed graph:

```text
traffic audience -> application -> process profile
                               -> named connection -> destination -> typed service
```

Validation rejects unresolved or orphaned graph elements. At runtime, application traffic uses
only the referenced application's eligible processes and the exact named destination/service; it
does not guess a process from a port or select a destination through a broad tag.
Every named application connection must have a traffic consumer; otherwise validation rejects it
as inert.

Traffic supports `weighted`, `periodic`, and `burst` cadence in the scenario's local timezone.
Cadence changes deterministic generation timing; it is not documentation-only. Low-level
`outbound` entries are reserved for legitimate processless/system traffic. Discover the stable,
packaged-only inventories allowed by the public schema with:

```bash
eforge info pack_builtin_application_ids
eforge info pack_builtin_dns_tags
```

Pack process document terms are scoped to their process profile and do not enter global command
pools. An industry storage entry supplies vocabulary, not a concrete host file set/server/share; a
scenario or organization selects its qualified preset while owning file-set roots, storage
topology, access, population, and activity. Storage vocabulary stays provider-neutral and contains
bounded relative directory,
subject, extension, and MIME components—not Windows drives, Linux mounts, backing filesystems,
Samba audit policy, or client-process profiles.

An organization may own bounded host file sets and the concrete cross-platform SMB environment:
Windows or Linux server systems, OS-native volume mounts and backing filesystems,
share-advertised filesystem labels,
access/audit settings, Windows drive or Linux mount mappings, and the services that grant Linux
baseline client/server capability. It must not copy internal `smb_profiles.yaml` into a pack or
depend on a project-only profile override. Those profiles are engine/project policy; the public organization
model selects stable modes such as `cifs_mount` or `smbclient` through canonical scenario fields.

Organization `environment` and `baseline_activity` files are typed partial canonical fragments.
A reusable organization should normally be self-contained enough for a thin Scenario 2.0 wrapper.
An intentionally partial organization must name and pass a representative consumer scenario before
it can be claimed usable.

## Composition and precedence

Effective generation data is applied in this order:

1. Installed EvidenceForge defaults.
2. Direct industry packs for additive exports.
3. The organization pack.
4. Project `.eforge/config` overlays under their established per-family merge rules.
5. Scenario-local model fields and authored overrides.

Packs are peers, not arbitrary recursive overlays. Industry order does not resolve incompatible
definitions: export collisions and incompatible identities fail with source and pack provenance.
An organization's exact locked dependencies are resolved before its own catalogs/model. The
compiled scenario records selected identities and digests, authored `field_origins`, qualified
`catalog_field_origins`, `organization_model_origins`, and concrete `merge_decisions`. Origin paths
are portable and retain the exact included YAML file that declared each value.

## Author packs through chat

Install the bundled agent skills, then use the matching workflow:

```bash
uv run eforge install-skills
```

- `/eforge pack` (Claude Code) or `eforge-pack` (ChatGPT/Codex) lists, compares, inspects,
  initializes, copies, versions, validates, and diagnoses packs.
- `/eforge industry-pack` or `eforge-industry-pack` authors reusable industry catalogs and proves
  them with a small consumer scenario.
- `/eforge organization-pack` or `eforge-organization-pack` authors concrete organizations,
  dependencies, and organization-only catalogs and proves their effective environment.
- `/eforge scenario` or `eforge-scenario` selects exact packs, chooses the monolithic/composed
  boundary, and authors the exercise-specific wrapper.
- `/eforge config` or `eforge-config` manages internal `.eforge/config` overlays, not packs.

The authoring skills use JSON command output for decisions, validate after coherent edits, resolve
a representative consumer with composition provenance, and run fixed-seed generation to verify
that pack fields affect evidence rather than merely serialize.

## CLI lifecycle

Use exact CLI references in the form `source:publisher:type:name@version`. Configure the authoring
identity explicitly before `pack init` or `pack copy`:

```bash
eforge pack list --json
eforge pack publisher set example-publisher --display-name "Example Publisher" \
  --scope project --json
eforge pack show package:evidenceforge:industry:healthcare@1.0.0 --json
eforge pack validate package:evidenceforge:organization:northstar-health@1.0.0 --json

# Create every canonical file under .eforge/packs; never overwrite.
eforge pack init industry custom-healthcare --version 0.1.0 --json

# Create an editable project-local fork with non-semantic copy provenance.
eforge pack copy package:evidenceforge:industry:healthcare@1.0.0 \
  --name tailored-healthcare --version 1.0.0 --json

# Preview and then atomically refresh only pack.lock.yaml.
eforge pack lock project:example-publisher:organization:example-care@1.0.0 --json
eforge pack lock project:example-publisher:organization:example-care@1.0.0 --apply --json

# Compile without generation and explain exact selection, origins, and precedence.
eforge resolve scenario.yaml --output resolved.yaml \
  --explain-composition --json
```

`pack show` reports six catalog `exports` plus `model_contributions`. Organization environment and
baseline fragments are not catalog exports, so empty catalog lists do not mean that an
organization lacks users, systems, topology, storage, or baseline content. To inspect actual
composed model values without writing an artifact, use a thin scenario wrapper and add
`--include-effective-scenario` to `resolve --explain-composition --json`. Treat a packaged pack's
filesystem `location` as diagnostic metadata rather than traversing the installed package during
scenario authoring.

`pack init` and `pack copy` publish atomically and refuse unsafe identities, traversal, symlinked
ancestry, or an existing destination. A renamed copy rewrites typed semantic self-references but
does not rewrite prose or dependency namespaces. There is no public pack-delete command.

Use a draft-aware version policy:

- Default a clearly identified new draft to `0.1.0` and a first complete pack to `1.0.0`.
- Edit in place only when an existing version is confirmed unshared, unreferenced, and still a
  draft.
- Copy a shared, referenced, or complete pack to a new exact version before editing.
- Use patch for compatible corrections, minor for compatible additions, and major for removals,
  renames, or incompatible behavior changes.

Validation covers fixed files and schemas, exact identity/compatibility/dependencies, include
containment and budgets, export collisions, catalog graph semantics, typed organization fragments,
and forbidden files. Structural validation alone cannot prove a partial organization; resolve,
validate, generate, and inspect its representative consumer.

## Included examples

EvidenceForge ships these ordinary, validated package packs:

- `package:evidenceforge:industry:finance@1.0.0`
- `package:evidenceforge:industry:healthcare@1.0.0`
- `package:evidenceforge:industry:technology@1.0.0`
- `package:evidenceforge:organization:northstar-health@1.0.0`

`northstar-health` constrains and locks the healthcare industry and demonstrates a concrete mixed environment,
email activity, and SMB-backed storage. The samples use the same public schemas and runtime paths
as custom packs; they are not special-cased built-ins.

## Includes, safety, and portability

Pack YAML may use bounded includes contained within its pack root. Included mappings must be
disjoint; includes compose fields rather than overriding them. Unknown YAML, duplicate keys,
traversal, symlink escape, cyclic/excessive includes, identity mismatch, incompatible versions,
unreachable semantic YAML, and export collisions fail validation.

Permitted non-semantic companions are `README.md`, `LICENSE`/`LICENSE.md`, and
`COPY_PROVENANCE.md`. They do not affect the pack digest. Executable hooks, scripts, binaries,
templates, corpora, and arbitrary assets are forbidden. Use fictional entities, reserved domains,
and reserved/private address ranges; never place secrets or live operator endpoints in reusable
packs.

## Authoritative generated bundles

Successful generation writes `RESOLVED_SCENARIO.yaml` and writes
`GENERATION_MANIFEST.json` last. The resolved document contains the canonical runtime scenario,
pack identities/digests, portable source provenance, embedded YAML/corpora, and immutable effective
configuration. Loading it bypasses authored includes, pack repositories, project discovery,
installed YAML reads, and ambient caches. It is generated and non-editable.

The generation manifest records runtime/build identity, effective seed/formats/target, permitted
overrides, selected pack digests, the resolved-file hash, and every bundle-file hash. Existing
domain sidecars remain; the manifest is the authoritative run identity.

When composed storage is present, `STORAGE_MANIFEST.json` schema v3 is the authoritative compiled
storage view. It records unique host file sets and share bindings without double-counting aliases,
retains pack-qualified presets, and separates server platform, backing and
SMB-advertised filesystems, Windows drive and Linux mount presentations, credential identity, and
resolved storyline targets. It is metadata-only and does not make a pack responsible for runtime
credentials or file payloads.

New bundles evaluate without an authored scenario:

```bash
eforge eval OUTPUT
```

`eforge eval OUTPUT --scenario scenario.yaml` recompiles the authored input with the manifest's
effective seed/options and fails on a digest mismatch. `--allow-scenario-mismatch` permits the
comparison mismatch, but evaluation still uses the bundle's resolved scenario. Legacy bundles
still require `--scenario`.

Literal OOB hosts always require a fresh matching `--oob-host` on validate, resolve, or generate.
Neither a pack nor a previously resolved document grants that authorization.
