# Generation Checkpoints and Resume

`eforge generate` creates crash-safe recovery points every 24 completed simulated hours by
default. The cadence counts continuously across warm-up and collection. Override it with
`--checkpoint-hours N`, or pass `--checkpoint-hours 0` to disable new checkpoints.
`eforge validate` accepts the same option so its peak-disk forecast matches the intended run.

Checkpointing is cadence-only. Generation does not force recovery points after initialization, at
phase boundaries, or before finalization. If a run ends before its first cadence point, it has no
recovery point and must restart after interruption. Otherwise, recovery replays work after the
latest committed point, including tail work or finalization when necessary. During hourly
generation, the first Ctrl+C requests a cooperative stop at the end of the current simulated hour.
When checkpointing is enabled, that safe boundary publishes a recovery point even when it is off
cadence; with `--checkpoint-hours 0`, generation stops there without creating one. A second Ctrl+C
forces immediate exit. Hard process termination never attempts an emergency checkpoint, so the
last atomically published point remains authoritative. On interruption or an ordinary failure, the
CLI reports whether a recovery point exists, its simulated hour and phase, and how to resume. A
resumed run reports the selected recovery cursor and effective cadence before continuing.

## Inspect or intentionally suspend a run

Thoroughly validate an output root without starting or hydrating the generator:

```bash
eforge checkpoint status ./bundle
eforge checkpoint status ./bundle --verbose
eforge checkpoint status ./bundle --json
```

Status authenticates the stored recovery objects but deliberately does not instantiate the
generator. To validate all participant schemas and deserialize every retained lifecycle, session,
emitter, and RNG state into isolated scratch storage, run:

```bash
eforge checkpoint verify ./bundle
eforge checkpoint verify ./bundle --verbose
eforge checkpoint verify ./bundle --json
```

Verification never writes to the bundle and never runs normal generator finalization. It reports
integrity, scratch initialization, participant `N/M` hydration, scratch cleanup, and completion so
large restores do not appear stuck. Its report includes the selected recovery, run identity,
loadability, behavior risk, output-equivalence status, and full-hydration result. Add `--verbose`
for bounded aged-out-parent examples and detailed drift records. JSON output remains free of
progress text.

The positional path is the bundle root—the directory that contains `data/`—not the `data/`
directory itself. When generation uses no explicit `--output`, the bundle root is the authored
scenario's parent directory. If `data/` is supplied by mistake, the command returns immediately
with the correct bundle-root command instead of scanning generated evidence.

The default human report shows the operational state, last recoverable phase-local hour, continuous
simulated-hour count, cadence, integrity and runtime compatibility, fallback warnings,
generated-data size, recovery overhead, total known managed working footprint, and the exact resume
command. For example, after a two-hour warm-up and one completed collection hour it reports
`collection hour 1 of 6 (3 total simulated hours completed)`. `--verbose` adds both recovery
generations, lock ownership, schema/run identities, participant and segment counts, fingerprint
components, detailed storage categories, and validation work. `--json` always emits the complete
structured report, independent of `--verbose`. Status is read-only and excludes unrelated files
from all managed totals. Checkpoint storage includes durable spool content already imported into
the hidden workspace.

For every checkpoint-enabled run, the hidden workspace and controller marker are created before
warm-up begins. Until the first cadence point commits, status reports
`Checkpoint state: active — no checkpoint yet`; an interruption in that interval still requires a
restart with `--overwrite`. A path with no checkpoint workspace reports
`Checkpoint state: no checkpoints found` without presenting zero-byte validation and storage
details as though they described a run.

Request a planned stop from another terminal:

```bash
eforge checkpoint suspend ./bundle
```

Suspension is cooperative, not immediate. The command returns after publishing the request and
reminds the operator that generation is still running. The generator finishes its current
simulated hour, reaches the normal quiescent barrier, publishes an explicit recovery point even
when that hour is off cadence, reports the suspended cursor, and exits successfully. An
off-cadence suspension does not move the cadence anchor: with a 24-hour cadence, suspending at hour
37 still leaves hour 48 as the next automatic checkpoint after resume. Repeating a pending request
is idempotent. Suspension requires an active checkpoint-enabled run.

In the generator's terminal, one Ctrl+C is a convenient local form of the same safe suspension: it
immediately acknowledges the request, finishes the current simulated hour, and publishes an
off-cadence recovery when checkpointing is enabled. The process then exits with status 130 rather
than the external suspension command's successful status. Press Ctrl+C again to force an immediate
exit and retain only the last recovery point that had already been published. With checkpointing
disabled, the first Ctrl+C still waits for the hour boundary but creates no recovery point. A
request that arrives after the last hourly barrier, while tail work or finalization is already
running, cannot interrupt that unsafe region and the run finishes normally.

## Resume an interrupted run

Resume while rechecking the authored scenario:

```bash
eforge generate scenario.yaml --output ./bundle --resume
```

Resume solely from the authoritative resolved input stored with the checkpoint:

```bash
eforge generate --output ./bundle --resume
```

An unspecified resumed run retains its stored cadence. An explicit `--checkpoint-hours` overrides
that cadence; `0` resumes from the selected point but creates no later checkpoints. The complete
output root may be moved or copied before resume because checkpoint metadata contains only relative
paths and its resolved input and immutable segments are self-contained. Stop the generator before
copying the root; copying an active workspace can capture an inconsistent set of files.

Resume separates immutable run identity, serialized-state loadability, and expected output drift.
`compatibility_level` remains the backward-oriented `exact|load-compatible|incompatible` summary;
status and verification schema 1.1 also report `run_identity`, `loadability`, `behavior_change`,
`confirmation_required`, and categorized run, runtime, behavior, and state-contract differences.

| Policy | Runtime/environment drift | Material or unknown EvidenceForge behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `exact` | Reject | Reject; the complete original fingerprint is required |
| `compatible` (default) | Attempt hydration | Ask interactively, default no; noninteractive use stops with verification guidance |
| `attempt` | Attempt hydration | Explicitly accepted without a prompt |

Python version/compiler/implementation, dependency versions, OS, architecture, interpreter cache
tag, and byte order are attemptable drift. Successful hydration permits continuation, but output
equivalence becomes `not-guaranteed`. `attempt` is consent to output risk, not a safety bypass.

Corruption, unsafe paths or ownership, missing checkpoint objects or participants, unsupported
checkpoint/participant schemas without an explicit decoder, and hydration failures always stop.
An explicitly supplied scenario, seed, format filter, or output target must match immutable run
identity. When those inputs are omitted, resume adopts the checkpoint's authoritative resolved
scenario, effective seed, formats, target, and other non-OOB run settings.

Live callbacks are a separate authorization boundary. A checkpoint never grants OOB permission.
If it records non-empty OOB hosts, every host must be supplied again with matching `--oob-host`
options; new or different hosts conflict with run identity.

EvidenceForge behavior risk comes from validated packaged `config/generation_behavior.yaml`
history. Exact builds are `exact`; different builds at the same revision are `none-declared`;
intervening `none`/`localized` records aggregate to `localized`; any intervening material record is
`material`. Missing history, gaps, downgrade, malformed metadata, or legacy build lineage are
`unknown`. For `material` or `unknown`, compatible interactive resume describes affected
domains/formats and defaults to refusal. Noninteractive use must run read-only verification and
then explicitly choose `--resume-policy attempt` if the risk is acceptable. `checkpoint verify`
always attempts statically load-compatible state because it is read-only.

After a load-compatible recovery fully hydrates, EvidenceForge atomically publishes a migration
checkpoint at the same cursor before generating another simulated hour. The original recovery
remains the fallback until normal rotation replaces it. Later checkpoints and the final generation
manifest record originating/resuming builds, runtime drift, behavior risk and change IDs, accepted
policy, confirmation status, cursor, and bounded migration lineage. If hydration or migration
publication fails, generation does not advance; the pre-migration staged bundle is restored and
the recovery index remains unchanged.

Interactive generation distinguishes a compatible incomplete run, an invalid or incompatible
checkpoint, and a completed bundle before offering valid actions. Scripts and redirected input
must choose explicitly with `--resume` or `--overwrite`. `--force` and `-f` remain deprecated
aliases for `--overwrite` for compatibility. Resume conflicts with overwrite.

## Workspace, safety, and final output

Recovery data lives under `.eforge-generation/` in the output root. It includes the staged bundle,
two recovery manifests and bounded live heads, shared content-addressed segments, resolved input,
and a single-run lock. The resource forecast reports this separately as `Projected checkpoint
workspace` and includes it once in projected peak working disk.

On macOS and Linux, checkpoint publication requires protected ownership, no symlinks or path
traversal, atomic rename, and durable file and directory synchronization. Preflight fails when
the filesystem cannot provide those guarantees; use another filesystem or explicitly pass
`--checkpoint-hours 0`. A demonstrably stale lock may be reclaimed, but concurrent generation
against the same output root is rejected.

Native Windows generation runs Python directly without WSL. Protected output journals, temporary
storage, and checkpoint workspaces require fixed local NTFS storage, restrictive ACLs, and paths
without reparse points such as junctions. Checkpoint publication uses buffered binary I/O,
explicit file flushing, and native write-through creation and rename handles. Newly created
checkpoint directories are staged and published through write-through renames; this supplies
the Windows namespace barrier instead of POSIX directory synchronization. Disabling checkpoints
does not bypass the native output-journal storage requirements.

Checkpoint dependencies become durable before the recovery index is published and acknowledged.
While the checkpoint remains retained, simulated power loss after acknowledgment must recover
that checkpoint or a newer complete point. This is conditional on stable pre-existing ancestry
and storage honoring flush/write-through requests. Native API and simulated power-loss CI tests
validate the publication protocol, not physical hardware power-loss safety or final bundle
publication. See the [native Windows design](../design/native-windows-filesystem.md) for tested
platforms and the full storage contract.

The newest corrupt recovery point produces a warning and falls back to the previous valid point.
Tampering, incompatible run inputs, unsupported schemas, failed hydration, and unsafe ownership are
rejected with an explanation. Checkpoints from unreleased development schemas are not migrated
without an explicit supported decoder.

Successful generation publishes through the normal bundle replacement rules, preserves unrelated
files, and removes `.eforge-generation/`. The completed generation manifest retains bounded resume
provenance when recovery occurred. Under an exact resume, deterministic evidence, resolved input,
ground truth, artifacts, and deterministic sidecars are byte-identical to uninterrupted
generation. A load-compatible resume makes no byte-equivalence promise; `generation.log` and the
time-bearing generation manifest retain their established nondeterministic fields in either case.

### Typed-validation snapshot compatibility

The typed-validation runtime recognizes exact immutable validation documents from baseline
`787fd733` (2.1.0). It promotes recognized legacy rules/schema metadata and evaluation thresholds
in memory, preserving the stored resolved snapshot and verifying identical native rendering
templates. Other old internal rule documents receive the existing actionable contract error.
This is a bounded decoder for package-owned metadata, not a user configuration migration surface.

`exact` still requires the original fingerprint and rejects drift without changing recovery state.
Default `compatible` performs normal isolated hydration and records the dependency/build transition
before continuing. The removed JSON Logic dependency remains visible in migration provenance.
The output-equivalence classification remains `not-guaranteed`; observed byte equality in a
regression test does not strengthen that guarantee. Corrupt, unsupported, and conflicting recovery
states retain their existing refusal behavior.
