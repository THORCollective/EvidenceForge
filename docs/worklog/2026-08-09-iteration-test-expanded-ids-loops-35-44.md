# Iteration Test Expanded IDS Assessment Loops 35-44

Scenario: `/Users/dabianco/projects/SURGe/EvidenceForge/scenarios/iteration-test-expanded-ids/scenario.yaml`

These loops begin from the integrated canonical-contract architecture. Loop 35
is a fresh baseline: no findings, scores, targets, or reports from loops 1-34
were used to select its improvements. Every loop regenerates data, runs the
deterministic evaluator, and gives only a neutral copy of the current data to
four independent blind reviewers.

## Pre-baseline Architecture Blocker

Fresh generation found a source-side SSH client whose outbound transport
outlived the inbound SSH session that owned the process. Source-process
attribution now requires the owning session to remain active through the full
transport; otherwise the canonical flow is retained without unsafe PID/user
attribution. Four focused tests passed, Ruff passed, and the full suite produced
5,289 passes plus 41 skips; its only sandbox failure was the localhost-port
Splunk harness test, which passed unrestricted.

## Loop 35 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 85,173 records; 95.91073999984621; automated FAIL only
  on pivot linkability (50/100). Canonical invariants, source schemas, field
  agreement, IDS integrity, and causal ordering all scored 100.
- **Blind panel:** Synthetic 3-1 at 64/64/28/66, average 55.5.
- **Deliberation:** Synthetic 3-1 at 68/69/44/71, average 63.0.
- **Fresh selected family:** version-specific source-native schema projection
  for Snort fast alerts, Security 4624 v2, and Sysmon Event 8 v2.
- **Owning abstraction:** emitter format definitions and source-native render
  adapters; canonical event truth remains unchanged.
- **Invariant:** rendered field labels, order, and presence match the declared
  native provider/version contract while preserving canonical values.
- **Sibling risks:** SIEM parsing, ordered XML fixtures, Snort classification
  semantics, Event 8 identity ownership, format validation, and deterministic
  output.

## Loop 36 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 85,173 newly generated records; 95.91073999984621;
  automated FAIL only on pivot linkability (50/100). Canonical invariants,
  schemas, field agreement, IDS integrity, and causal ordering passed.
- **Blind panel:** Real/Inconclusive/Synthetic/Synthetic at 32/49/67/78,
  average 56.5.
- **Deliberation:** likely Synthetic 3-1 at 55/63/72/77, average 66.8.
- **Loop 35 target confirmation:** none of the four fresh reports repeated the
  Snort-classification, Security-4624-order, or Sysmon-Event-8-user defects.
- **Fresh selected family:** half-open source admission for endpoint lifecycle
  closures at the collection boundary.
- **Owning abstraction:** final source observation admission in the canonical
  dispatcher, after lifecycle expansion and source-native timing.
- **Invariant:** every discrete source record has a visible timestamp in
  `[output_start, output_end)`; in-progress objects remain open when their
  closure occurs after the window.
- **Sibling risks:** process/logon lifecycle pairing, cross-source termination
  agreement, source observation jitter, sensor interval records, and documented
  collection-profile tail semantics.

## Loop 37 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 85,138 newly generated records; 95.91042019060161;
  automated FAIL only on pivot linkability (50/100). Schemas, canonical
  invariants, field agreement, IDS integrity, and causal ordering passed.
- **Blind panel:** unanimous Synthetic at 76/71/72/68, average 71.75. No
  deliberation trigger: all verdict confidences were at least 84 and score spread
  was eight points.
- **Loop 36 target confirmation:** zero records at or after the 18:00 cutoff and
  no fresh reviewer repeated the endpoint termination-tail finding.
- **Rejected finding:** the reported Security 5156 direction inversion used the
  WFP message tokens backwards. Microsoft source-native semantics confirm that
  `%%14592`/`%%14610` is inbound receive/accept and
  `%%14593`/`%%14611` is outbound connect, matching current tuple placement.
- **Fresh selected family:** sensor-local file completeness before dependent
  X.509, OCSP, and PE analyzers.
- **Owning abstraction:** frozen network sensor observation plan; emitters only
  render the analyzer visibility already decided for each file and sensor.
- **Invariant:** incomplete file observations cannot yield full decoded analyzer
  rows or full-file fingerprints; complete observations retain canonical IDs.
- **Sibling risks:** SSL certificate FUID references, files.log hashes/analyzers,
  OCSP HTTP fan-out, PE analysis, multi-sensor variance, and parser ordering.

## Loop 38 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 85,068 newly generated records; 95.9090570499255;
  automated FAIL only on pivot linkability (50/100). Schemas, canonical
  invariants, IDS integrity, and causal ordering passed.
- **Blind panel:** unanimous Synthetic at 65/68/95/72, average 75.0. No
  deliberation trigger: all verdict confidences were at least 80 and the score
  spread was exactly 30 points.
- **Loop 37 target confirmation:** incomplete files produced zero X.509, OCSP,
  or PE analyzer intersections on either sensor. The Network reviewer also
  independently explained missing certificate analysis through incomplete file
  capture rather than reporting the prior contradiction.
- **Fresh selected family:** canonical Zeek connection-state and packet-history
  consistency.
- **Owning abstraction:** `NetworkTransactionPlan`; sensor observations and the
  Zeek emitter project its already-consistent transport truth.
- **Invariant:** RSTR terminates with lowercase responder `r`, RSTO with
  uppercase originator `R`, and S1 contains no observed reset/close marker.
- **Sibling risks:** generator history pools, sensor-specific network
  observations, emitter projection, packet-actor direction, ASA teardown
  reasons, and deterministic evaluator assertions.

## Loop 39 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 83,175 newly generated records; 96.30232345905807;
  automated FAIL only on pivot linkability (51.6129/100).
- **Blind panel:** Real/Inconclusive/Inconclusive/Synthetic at 35/42/43/67,
  average 46.75. Verdict disagreement and a 32-point spread triggered
  deliberation.
- **Deliberation:** unanimous Synthetic at 72/66/69/86, average 73.25.
- **Loop 38 target confirmation:** all generated RSTR, RSTO, and S1 histories
  satisfy their Zeek actor/termination semantics, and the Network reviewer
  independently described the resulting combinations as plausible.
- **Fresh selected family:** Event 4648 source-native Network Information.
- **Owning abstraction:** Windows explicit-credential action bundle and its
  canonical `AuthContext`; the Security emitter remains a renderer.
- **Invariant:** Network Address identifies the attempt's origin, never its
  target; Port is zero/blank for local use or the real source port owned by the
  corresponding remote transport, never a separately sampled value.
- **Sibling risks:** RunAs, scheduled tasks, PsExec/WMIC/service-control
  bundles, caller process/session ownership, transport correlation, parser
  normalization, evaluator pivoting, and source-native XML tests.

## Loop 40 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 83,943 fresh records; 96.08685376090904; FAIL only on
  pivot linkability (50/100).
- **Blind panel:** Real/Inconclusive/Synthetic/Synthetic at 26/52/63/66,
  average 51.75; disagreement and a 40-point spread triggered deliberation.
- **Deliberation:** unanimous Synthetic at 64/68/69/74, average 68.75.
- **Loop 39 target confirmation:** all 32 Event 4648 rows identify the attempt
  origin and use zero unless a real remote source endpoint is explicitly owned;
  no fresh reviewer repeated the target-address or invented-port defect.
- **Fresh selected family:** Windows OpenSSH client process ancestry.
- **Owning abstraction:** process planner/action bundle parent selection before
  Security, Sysmon, and eCAR projection.
- **Invariant:** ordinary user-launched `ssh.exe` descends from a visible,
  active shell, terminal, or explicit launcher/handler; unrelated browser and
  mail processes are never generic parents.
- **Sibling risks:** session ownership, source-visible process timing,
  parent lifetime, remote-admin transport actor identity, process pools,
  storyline compatibility, and three-source process correlation.

## Loop 41 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 88,028 fresh records; 95.82987695897476; FAIL only on
  pivot linkability (50/100).
- **Blind panel:** Inconclusive/Synthetic/Real/Synthetic at 45/68/36/67,
  average 54.0; disagreement and a 32-point spread triggered deliberation.
- **Deliberation:** unanimous Synthetic at 63/70/66/64, average 65.75.
- **Loop 40 target confirmation:** all 61 Windows `ssh.exe` processes descend
  from `cmd.exe` or `powershell.exe` in the same active logon session; no fresh
  reviewer repeated the browser/mail-parent defect.
- **Fresh selected family:** actor-native Windows file and registry side
  effects, especially WER, Defender, CBS, Office MRU, and Explorer state.
- **Owning abstraction:** endpoint side-effect planning and data-driven
  eligibility before Sysmon/eCAR rendering.
- **Invariant:** a visible process may own only artifacts that its executable
  family can natively create or modify; source renderers preserve that causal
  ownership without substituting actors.
- **Sibling risks:** service/update process availability, user/session identity,
  registry hive eligibility, installer inventory, file action semantics,
  ProcessGuid correlation, and output volume/distribution.

## Loop 42 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 79,750 fresh records; 96.11472158905761; FAIL only on
  pivot linkability (51.6129/100).
- **Blind panel:** Inconclusive/Inconclusive/Synthetic/Synthetic at 43/43/88/87,
  average 65.25; disagreement and a 45-point spread triggered deliberation.
- **Deliberation:** unanimous Synthetic at 82/84/91/91, average 87.0.
- **Loop 41 target confirmation:** zero ambient WER, CBS, or Office-registry
  rows; Defender history is owned only by `MsMpEng.exe`; no current reviewer
  repeated the former process/artifact ownership contradiction.
- **Fresh selected family:** additive CONNECT control-message and tunnel-payload
  accounting on the canonical client-to-proxy TCP stream.
- **Owning abstraction:** proxy transaction action contract plus source-native
  proxy projection from canonical network totals.
- **Invariant:** for a successful CONNECT, control bytes plus tunneled payload
  equal the canonical TCP directional totals; terminal deny/auth outcomes have
  no tunnel payload or duration fields.
- **Sibling risks:** tunnel reuse, SSL inspection rows, Zeek `conn`/`http`
  agreement, ASA aggregate accounting, cache/deny outcomes, Splunk/SOF-ELK®
  projections, parser normalization, and file-transfer sizing.

## Loop 43 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 79,750 fresh records; 96.11472158905761; FAIL only on
  pivot linkability (51.6129/100).
- **Blind panel:** Inconclusive/Synthetic/Synthetic/Synthetic at 44/87/67/87,
  average 71.25; disagreement and a 43-point spread triggered deliberation.
- **Deliberation:** unanimous Synthetic at 88/93/89/94, average 91.0.
- **Loop 42 target confirmation:** matched proxy connections never equal the
  tunnel-only ledger; successful control plus tunnel scopes reconstruct the TCP
  total, terminal denials have no tunnel fields, and the Network reviewer called
  the corrected scoping realistic.
- **Fresh selected family:** named singleton Windows service process ownership.
- **Owning abstraction:** system-process planner and canonical running-process
  state before Security, Sysmon, and eCAR projection.
- **Invariant:** one host has at most one active `svchost -s <service>` process
  per named singleton service; repeated baseline activity reuses that process or
  owns an explicit terminate/restart transition.
- **Sibling risks:** service command parsing, multi-service svchost groups,
  service restarts, out-of-order generation, process activity timestamps,
  scheduled-task selection, and three-source lifecycle correlation.

## Loop 44 Outcome

- **Generation/eval:** 83,707 fresh records; 96.02555389939702; FAIL only on
  pivot linkability (51.6129/100).
- **Blind panel:** Real/Synthetic/Synthetic/Synthetic at 29/89/72/58, average
  62.0; disagreement and a 60-point spread triggered deliberation.
- **Deliberation:** unanimous Synthetic at 88/94/91/92, average 91.25, with
  consensus verdict confidence 96.
- **Loop 43 target confirmation:** 28 named `svchost -s` creations mapped to 28
  distinct host/service pairs with zero overlapping live instances; no fresh
  reviewer repeated the named-service singleton contradiction.
- **Fresh high-priority findings for the next assessment set:** canonical
  binary hashes vary with user installation paths; multiple software builds
  postdate the evidence clock; one explicit-credential event names a caller
  after three sources terminate it; Type 5 logons uniformly self-populate
  `WorkstationName`; and DNS/DHCP infrastructure texture remains thin.
- **Owning abstractions for future work:** binary artifact/version inventory,
  canonical process-liveness and explicit-credential bundle timing,
  logon-type-native rendering matrices, and DNS/DHCP action bundles.
- **Final verification:** the full suite produced 5,295 passes and 41 skips.
  Two stale documentation/observation assertions were corrected and passed in
  focused reruns; the sole localhost-bind sandbox failure passed unrestricted.
