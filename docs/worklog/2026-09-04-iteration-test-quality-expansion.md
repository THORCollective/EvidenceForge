# Iteration-Test Quality Expansion

## Scope

Expand the six-hour iteration benchmark around data-quality coverage: a second domain
controller, a Linux Samba server, a centralized log/monitoring server, database SPAN
visibility, cross-platform SMB activity, correlated remote administration, multipart
archive exfiltration, and a late benign SSH investigation. Preserve the historical
Meridian 1.0.0 pack and all prior blind-assessment reports.

## Authored changes

- Created project-local organization pack
  `project:davidjbianco:organization:meridian-healthcare-solutions@1.1.0` by copying
  the packaged 1.0.0 release.
- Added `DC-02`, `FILE-LNX-01`, and `LOG-MON-01`, Linux SMB clients and mappings,
  the XFS-backed `ClinicalResearch` Samba share, and `zeek-db`.
- Added the planned malicious and benign storyline beats while retaining the six-hour
  window, seed, warmup, observation profile, and output formats.
- Updated the attack-free environment briefing and scenario pack reference.

## Engine findings and fixes

1. Linux SMB source-only eCAR projection failed generation because endpoint source
   timing incorrectly required a target-local transport-close deadline. The source
   timing planner now accepts its preferred timestamp when that target-local deadline
   does not exist. A focused regression test covers the source-only projection.
2. Explicit DC-01 to DC-02 remote service installation originally selected the user's
   primary workstation for SMB/RPC. `service_installed` now accepts an optional
   `source_ip`, resolves it through the world model, and passes the resulting system to
   the Windows remote-service action bundle. The bundle remains the canonical owner of
   the SMB/RPC transport. A focused test verifies that an authored source overrides the
   user's primary system.

## Validation and generation

- Pack validation: valid. Meridian 1.1.0 digest:
  `3cbe51326bbb8bab04b6936c5e2d853d76eafb2bf73ddf5a24994db2e29ebec4`.
- Locked technology dependency unchanged:
  `11e90fb8aa02c2a97d55b6a90fb9b7c192470215174f10f2832da6c253c62928`.
- Scenario validation: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 24 informational pivot suggestions.
- Resolved composition: 21 systems, 49 storyline events, 10 red herrings, six sensors.
- Generation succeeded through hour 6 and atomically replaced the prior output.
- Generated corpus: 111,598 records across 22 parsed source families.

## Automated evaluation

- Overall: 95.8753 (96 rounded).
- Parseability: 99.9202.
- Plausibility: 97.0032.
- Causality: 92.2298.
- Timing: 92.9550.
- The requested overall threshold is met and no pillar is at or below 90.
- The evaluator's independent hard gate remains failed for temporal integrity
  (81.6327, threshold 85). Its reported misses are mainly pre-existing event-presence,
  pivot, and timing behavior; retain this as follow-up engine-quality work rather than
  expanding the current scenario-data effort.

## Focused evidence verification

- DC-01 to DC-02 now has Zeek SMB and DCE/RPC flows immediately before the target
  network logon and `DirectoryCacheSvc` creation/process evidence. Cleanup commands
  use the same target session context.
- `zeek-db` observes application-to-database MySQL traffic.
- Samba server syslog/eCAR and Zeek SMB records preserve Linux paths, XFS share
  identity, principals, authentication protocols, outcomes, and cross-platform client
  paths for mounted and direct clients.
- The staged ZIP read is owned by the generated `curl.exe` PID; proxy and ground-truth
  metadata agree on URI, multipart filename/MIME, decoded size 18,782,613 bytes, and
  the 2,048-byte response body (proxy wire bytes include protocol overhead).
- Priya's SSH transport/authentication precedes `journalctl`; no explicit authored
  logoff exists, and the action-owned lifecycle closes at the collection boundary.

## Assessment

A new standalone blind assessment was saved as `v2-loop-31`; prior loops and reports
remain unchanged. All four reviewers returned Synthetic verdicts with synthetic-confidence
scores of 95, 88, 96, and 86 (average 91.25). Deliberation was not needed because the verdicts
were unanimous and the score spread was only 10 points.

Final acceptance is blocked by new P0/P1 contradictions in the expanded families: inconsistent
Type 9 local-file principal ownership, Samba transfer effects attached to a directory-creation
process, impossible bidirectional/zero-payload UDP syslog accounting, and destination-as-source
Windows network-logon fields on the new DC. The full prioritized list is in
`scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/v2-loop-31/REPORT.md`; lower-severity findings remain for
later engine-quality loops.

## Assessment loop 32 — endpoint effect ownership

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical process/session state and the HTTP-upload and SMB action
  bundles that attach endpoint file/network effects to a process.
- **Invariant:** a local file effect uses the owning process's local token principal even when
  the same process has outbound NewCredentials, and every SMB effect with PID/process identity
  is owned by a process whose executable/command can perform that SMB operation.
- **Entry paths:** storyline connection multipart staging, baseline and storyline HTTP uploads,
  Windows-native SMB, mounted-CIFS SMB, direct `smbclient`, causal file effects, and raw
  storyline process references.
- **Consumers:** eCAR process/file/flow records, Windows Security/Sysmon process companions,
  Samba audit, Zeek SMB/files/conn, ground truth, and endpoint ownership probes.
- **Layer rationale:** process state owns the local token and action bundles own effect-causing
  process selection. Renderer-only rewriting would leave sibling sources and future callers
  contradictory.
- **Sibling risks:** the fix must cover non-sample upload and SMB operations, avoid changing the
  remote SMB credential/effective identity, and preserve explicit capable process ownership.
  Broader actor-native Windows registry/file side effects remain outside this loop.

### Result

- Focused generated-data probe passed: local archive effects retain Aisha's local token,
  outbound upload credentials remain Marcus, the Windows SMB client uses Explorer rather than
  the unrelated `New-Item` PID, and Samba retains Marcus as the remote principal.
- Automated evaluation was 95.8246 across 111,587 records; temporal integrity remained below
  its hard gate.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 99, 97, 94, and 98 (average
  97.0). The next dominant blocker is a repeated Sysmon native timestamp contradiction.

## Assessment loop 33 — atomic Sysmon process timing

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** `SourceTimingPlanner`'s host-shared Sysmon process lifecycle pair.
- **Invariant:** Event 1 and Event 5 payload `UtcTime` and provider-envelope `TimeCreated` are
  projections of the same exact occurrence; an instance-local retained envelope may not be
  combined with a separately resolved native timestamp.
- **Entry paths:** baseline process starts/stops, storyline processes, RDP/SSH client processes,
  services, causal process companions, and collection-boundary finalization.
- **Consumers:** Sysmon Event 1/5, Security 4688/4689 ordering, eCAR process correlation,
  ProcessGuid identity, and dependent Sysmon Event 3/7/11/22 ordering.
- **Layer rationale:** the planner owns both timestamps as one canonical source-native pair.
  Repairing XML after rendering would leave ProcessGuid and sibling timing contracts stale.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve parent-before-child and create-before-dependent ordering, provider
  latency, deterministic rendering, exact-publication replay, and termination containment.

### Result

- The generated hard probe reduced Sysmon payload/envelope differences over one second from 132
  to zero across 4,682 rows.
- Automated evaluation remained 95.8248 across 111,587 records.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 98, 96, 95, and 94 (average
  95.75). All endpoint reviewers converged on eCAR process dependents preceding exact creation.

## Assessment loop 34 — process starts before session dependents

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** source-timing process lifecycle and session dependency frontiers.
- **Invariant:** a process creation follows its visible session login but precedes every module,
  flow, file, registry, child-process, and termination event carrying its exact process identity.
- **Entry paths:** baseline applications, SSH/RDP clients and receivers, storyline processes,
  service processes, causal effects, PID reuse, and terminal lifecycle publication.
- **Consumers:** eCAR PROCESS/dependent records, Sysmon ProcessGuid lifecycles, Security 4688/4689,
  parent-child identity, and source-timing validation.
- **Layer rationale:** process creation is a prerequisite, so session frontier logic must not
  reorder it as if it were an ordinary dependent. Renderer sorting cannot repair identity state.
- **Sibling risks:** retain login-before-process, termination-after-dependent, session closure,
  parent-before-child, immutable PID-generation identity, and bounded cache behavior.

### Result

- The generated hard probe reduced eCAR exact-identity dependents preceding creation from 855
  across 101 identities to zero across 31,615 records.
- The same source-timing repair reduced live Sysmon PID-generation overlaps from 55 to zero.
- Automated evaluation remained 95.8248 across 111,587 records.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 93, 84, 95, and 88 (average
  90.0). All endpoint reviewers independently confirmed the repaired process/PID ordering.

## Assessment loop 35 — Windows service execution identity

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** authored Windows service definition plus canonical process/session
  ownership for the SCM-launched service executable.
- **Invariant:** a service process inherits the configured built-in service account, logon ID,
  integrity, and `services.exe` parent; the remote installer remains the subject of installation
  but never becomes the service process token.
- **Entry paths:** service installation before process start, process intent before a later
  same-cluster service definition, remote administration, arbitrary service executable names,
  and LocalSystem/LocalService/NetworkService aliases.
- **Consumers:** Security 4688/4689 and 4697, Sysmon Event 1/5 and module records, eCAR process and
  dependent records, service lifecycle reconciliation, and ground truth.
- **Layer rationale:** storyline intent binds an authored service definition to canonical process
  identity. Rewriting only one emitter would preserve contradictory actor/session state elsewhere.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve the remote installer on 4697, explicit network-logon continuity,
  service payload ownership, lifecycle grouping, child-command inheritance, and non-built-in
  domain service accounts.

### Result

- The generated hard probe confirmed `DirectoryCacheSvc` keeps Marcus Chen as the 4697 installer
  while Security, Sysmon, and eCAR render the running process as LocalSystem with logon ID `0x3e7`,
  System integrity, and `services.exe` parentage.
- Automated evaluation was 95.8280 across 111,587 records; temporal integrity remained below its
  hard gate.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 92, 90, 94, and 68 (average 86.0).
  No reviewer repeated the repaired service-process identity finding.

## Assessment loop 36 — immutable Windows logon-session identity

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical Windows authentication/session state, with local token identity
  distinct from outbound NewCredentials identity.
- **Invariant:** one Windows LUID is permanently bound to one local SID/account for its lifetime.
  Type 9 credentials may change only outbound authentication fields; a process attributed locally
  to another principal requires a distinct session and LUID.
- **Entry paths:** `runas /netonly`, explicit credentials, stolen-session storyline actions,
  Windows-native SMB, archive staging, HTTP upload, interactive bootstrap, and process inheritance.
- **Consumers:** Security 4624/4688/4689, Sysmon Event 1/5, eCAR process/file/flow rows, outbound SMB
  and proxy authentication, session lifecycle validation, and ground truth.
- **Layer rationale:** the contradiction is shared by three endpoint sources, so the session/token
  owner must be corrected in canonical state rather than rewritten independently by emitters.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve Marcus as the outbound SMB/proxy principal where authored; retain
  Aisha as the local `runas /netonly` token; allocate and close any distinct stolen-user session;
  avoid changing service-account, RDP, SSH, or network-logon semantics.

### Result

- The generated probe found zero cross-principal uses of the Type 9 LUID. Aisha owns every attached
  process and local profile path; Marcus remains the outbound credential principal.
- Automated evaluation was 95.8281 across 111,625 records; temporal integrity remained below its
  hard gate.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 88, 68, 84, and 64 (average 76.0).
  No reviewer repeated the repaired LUID-ownership contradiction.

## Assessment loop 37 — one-way UDP syslog accounting

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical role-profile connection intent and protocol-aware transport
  accounting for one-way datagram services.
- **Invariant:** a successful UDP/514 syslog delivery carries application payload only from sender
  to collector. The collector contributes no responder application bytes or packets; any ICMP error
  is a separate failed-network occurrence, never a bulk response on the syslog flow.
- **Entry paths:** log-server inbound role profiles, direct role-profile connections, multi-sensor
  observations, perimeter-denied attempts, and future explicit UDP syslog actions.
- **Consumers:** Zeek conn rows on every observing sensor, eCAR FLOW, firewall projections, packet
  and IP-byte accounting, protocol classifiers, and blind network review.
- **Layer rationale:** reverse traffic is invented by generic baseline profile sizing before fan-out,
  so the fix belongs at canonical connection intent rather than in Zeek or another renderer.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve realistic nonzero sender bytes/packets, UDP header accounting, sensor
  agreement, denied/S0 zero-payload behavior, TCP/514 semantics, and bidirectional UDP protocols such
  as DNS, DHCP, and NTP.

### Result

- The generated hard probe found 263 UDP/514 observations across all three sensors with zero
  responder payload bytes, packets, or IP bytes; 232 retained nonzero sender payload.
- A generation-time RDP assertion exposed insufficient SSH-client teardown headroom. The SSH
  transport clamp now reserves the full deterministic source-process termination tail before an
  authoritative source-session end.
- Automated evaluation increased to 96.4760 across 115,117 records and passed every hard gate; all
  four pillars exceed 93.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 68, 84, 94, and 91 (average 84.25).
  No reviewer repeated the repaired UDP/syslog contradiction.

## Assessment loop 38 — exact multipart upload ownership

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** explicit-proxy transaction action bundle plus canonical process identity
  selected for an authored HTTP upload.
- **Invariant:** one exact process owns the multipart command, local archive read, client-to-proxy
  tuple, eCAR FLOW, Sysmon Event 3, proxy request, and process termination. A neighboring probe
  process may not inherit the upload tuple merely because it shares executable, user, host, or URL.
- **Entry paths:** authored multipart uploads, benign support uploads, explicit proxy CONNECT reuse,
  curl/browser process discovery, existing process reuse, and source PID inference.
- **Consumers:** eCAR PROCESS/FILE/FLOW, Sysmon Event 1/3/5/11, proxy access records, Zeek conn/http,
  multipart and artifact metadata, ground truth, and upload hard probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the proxy action bundle owns the logical request and must carry the authored
  process identity into the canonical client leg. Renderer-side PID replacement would leave the
  source process, endpoint effects, and lifecycle state contradictory.
- **Sibling risks:** keep benign and malicious multipart uploads distinct, preserve tunnel reuse and
  source-port identity, avoid duplicating process creation, retain local token versus outbound
  credential semantics, and keep every process alive through its owned network/file dependents.

### Result

- The proxy transaction now treats a validated caller-owned PID as authoritative for its nested
  client transport, so CONNECT semantics cannot replace the multipart upload process with a nearby
  generic curl process. Anonymous multipart activity may still materialize a suitable owner.
- The generated probe found PID `7140` and process object `c6e27dd8-a08d-4357-8d08-003808c23911`
  consistently across the upload command, ZIP read, eCAR flow, Sysmon Event 3, proxy source port
  `57936`, and later termination.
- The routine suite passed 8,204 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff
  checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation scored 95.8011 across 110,715 records. The four pillars remained above 91,
  but pivot linkability and temporal integrity missed their hard thresholds, so acceptance failed.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 94, 66, 94, and 86 (average 85.0).
  No reviewer repeated the upload-ownership contradiction; multiple reviewers explicitly praised
  the repaired exfiltration correlation.

## Assessment loop 39 — process-visible ordering for dependent endpoint effects

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical process lifecycle and source-timing planner for process-dependent
  endpoint effects.
- **Invariant:** when a process creation is visible in a source, every dependent event carrying that
  exact process identity must render after the source-local create. No DNS, network, module, file,
  registry, access, or remote-thread event may precede Event 1/PROCESS CREATE for the same identity.
- **Entry paths:** RDP client startup and DNS prerequisites, ordinary process-to-network expansion,
  explicit proxy and SSH clients, storyline processes, baseline applications, and observation delay.
- **Consumers:** Sysmon Event 1/3/7/8/10/11/12-14/22, eCAR PROCESS and dependent objects, RDP and
  network action bundles, process source bounds, and lifecycle validators.
- **Layer rationale:** the inversion is created by independent source-time planning for a shared
  canonical process and its dependent event. The source planner/lifecycle owner must enforce one
  atomic frontier rather than patching Sysmon DNS output.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve DNS-before-transport semantics, cross-source jitter, session readiness,
  RDP transport-before-auth ordering, collection-boundary behavior, and valid pre-window processes
  whose creation is intentionally absent.

### Result

- Sysmon dependent timing now keys DNS events to their exact query process and shares the Event 1
  source frontier for every process-visible dependent family.
- The generated hard probe checked 578 Event 3/7/8/10/11/12-14/22 records with visible matching
  Event 1 identities and found zero inversions. The reported `mstsc.exe` PID `5380` Event 1 rendered
  at `13:15:14.241643Z`; its first DNS event followed at `13:15:14.244244Z`.
- The routine suite passed 8,205 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff
  checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation remained 95.8011 across 110,715 records. All pillars exceeded 91, but pivot
  linkability and temporal integrity remained below their hard thresholds.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 82, 64, 72, and 72 (average 72.5,
  spread 18). Neither endpoint reviewer repeated the fixed process-ordering contradiction.

## Assessment loop 40 — receiver file availability before SMB upload

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** ordered storyline action execution and canonical file-transfer lifecycle.
- **Invariant:** an SMB client may read a local source file only after that exact path has been
  created on the client host. When SCP supplies the file, receiver creation must precede every
  SMB process read, network transfer, and server-side write derived from it.
- **Entry paths:** storyline SCP commands, receiver file materialization, direct `smbclient` writes,
  mounted CIFS writes, HTTP multipart reads, and archive/staging chains.
- **Consumers:** source-host eCAR file events, SMB client processes, Zeek SMB/file records, Samba or
  Windows server audit, causal ordering, and ground-truth chronology.
- **Layer rationale:** availability is shared canonical state owned by the transfer/storyline
  lifecycle. Moving one rendered file row would leave the SMB transport and server mutation able to
  consume a file that does not yet exist.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve authored event order where feasible, do not duplicate SCP receiver
  creation, keep process ownership and authentication identity distinct, and retain deterministic
  explicit offsets for independent storyline events.

### Result

- SCP receiver publication now records the exact host/path availability frontier, and storyline SMB
  uploads of that local path wait until the canonical receiver file exists.
- The generated chain rendered the APP-INT-01 receiver create at `17:21:34.302Z`, SMB client read at
  `17:21:36.765Z`, and FILE-LNX-01 server write at `17:21:36.853Z`.
- The routine suite passed 8,206 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff
  checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation rose to 95.8512 across 110,715 records. Pivot linkability reached 80.0 and
  passed, leaving temporal integrity as the only failed hard gate.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 72, 91, 72, and 74 (average 77.25,
  spread 19). No reviewer repeated the premature-read contradiction, and reviewers described Samba
  timing and lifecycle correlation as especially strong.

## Assessment loop 41 — protocol-independent Zeek file hash rendering

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** Zeek Files-framework source renderer.
- **Invariant:** one Zeek sensor renders MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 using the same lowercase hexadecimal
  convention regardless of whether file analysis originated from SMB, HTTP, SMTP, or TLS.
- **Entry paths:** SMB reads/writes, HTTP request and response bodies, SMTP attachments, TLS
  certificate analysis, capture-loss projections, and repeated file observations.
- **Consumers:** Zeek `files.log` JSON, FUID/content pivots, SMB durability checks, TLS fingerprint
  agreement, deterministic evaluator field agreement, and blind network review.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical content identity deliberately remains source-neutral; hexadecimal
  presentation belongs to the source-native Zeek renderer and must not leak the capitalization used
  by endpoint-oriented identity objects.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve digest values and lengths, TLS SHA-1-to-x509 fingerprint agreement,
  repeated-file stability, sparse/absent hashes, and all non-Zeek consumers of canonical digests.

### Result

- The Zeek Files renderer now normalizes every present MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 digest to lowercase
  without changing canonical source-neutral content identities.
- The generated hard probe inspected 1,941 Zeek files rows and 3,507 digest values across `zeek-db`,
  `zeek-core`, and `zeek-dmz`. All 480 SMB and 3,027 non-SMB values were lowercase.
- The routine suite passed 8,206 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff
  checks passed across 753 files. The exact legacy slow SMB test remains independently red because
  it assumes every observed row has hashes and every client read belongs to `robocopy.exe`; this
  loop did not weaken that unrelated assertion.
- Automated evaluation remained 95.8512 across 110,715 records. Temporal integrity at 83.67 is the
  sole failed hard gate.
- The blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with scores 99, 99, 99, and 97 (average 98.5,
  spread 2). No reviewer repeated the hash-capitalization defect; the network reviewer explicitly
  praised SMB hashes and complete Zeek joins.

## Ten-loop assessment summary — loops 32–41

The requested ten-loop run repaired ten bounded evidence-family contracts and produced one fresh,
standalone four-reviewer panel per loop. Exact reports and per-loop scores are archived under
`scenarios/iteration-test/blind-test/v2-loop-32` through `v2-loop-41`; the final directory also
contains a 20-loop dashboard spanning loops 22–41.

The strongest final capabilities are deterministic parseability, network/endpoint tuple agreement,
IDS pivots, SMB auditing, attack-chain reconstruction, multipart exfiltration ownership, Windows
service identity, and endpoint process ordering. Acceptance is not complete: temporal integrity
remains below its hard threshold. Blind review also leaves systemic realism work in Sysmon session
GUIDs, remote-execution attribution, proxy tunnel lifetimes, ASA ID chronology, one-shot Linux
process duration, SSH observation coherence, collection-boundary handling, public DNS/PTR identity,
TTL state, and SMB/SMTP reuse. These are follow-on engine-quality families, not scenario edits.

## Assessment loop 42 — proxy tunnel lifetime ownership

### Finding classification

- Proxy setup rows ending before visible inspected children: `new_family`, confirmed across 114
  tunnels by the loop-41 network reviewer.
- Near-universal zero Sysmon `LogonGuid`: `false_positive_or_unproven`; native Microsoft examples
  legitimately use the null GUID for local Negotiate, NTLM, and several RDP paths, and the current
  generator already produces stable nonzero GUIDs for Kerberos-backed sessions.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** proxy emitter's bounded pending-tunnel summary, which owns the
  source-native CONNECT lifetime after all visible child requests have been folded.
- **Invariant:** `tunnel_duration_ms` must span both the canonical client transport and every
  proxy-visible child transaction assigned to the CONNECT channel.
- **Entry paths:** explicit HTTPS proxy transactions, reused CONNECT channels, raw compatibility
  proxy events, incremental checkpoint finalization, and final emitter closure.
- **Consumers:** combined proxy logs, Splunk proxy JSON, tunnel/child correlation probes, evaluator
  proxy parsing, and blind network review.
- **Layer rationale:** the canonical transport duration and visible child frontier are both known
  only when the proxy source finalizes its summary; rendering either input alone can understate the
  source-native channel lifetime.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve exact child byte aggregation, inactivity-timeout channel splitting,
  setup timing, denied/cache terminal actions, output-target parity, and collection-boundary rules.

### Result

- Proxy setup lifetime now spans both the canonical transport and the last visible child request.
- The hard probe parsed 548 setup rows and 792 children; zero children ended after their owning
  tunnel, eliminating the loop-41 contradiction.
- The routine suite passed 8,206 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff
  lint and format checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation remained 95.8512 across 110,715 records. Temporal integrity at 83.67 remains
  the only failed hard gate.
- Standalone blind scores were 44, 88, 64, and 89 (average 71.25; spread 45). Verdict disagreement
  triggered deliberation; after cross-specialty evidence was shared, all four positions were
  Synthetic with an average revised synthetic confidence of 84.25.
- No reviewer repeated the proxy-lifetime defect. The next highest proven root contract is durable
  Sysmon process identity across create, terminate, PID 4, and dependent-event projections.

## Assessment loop 43 — durable Sysmon process identity

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** the host-shared Sysmon process-create timing anchor in
  `SourceTimingPlanner`.
- **Invariant:** one host/PID/start lifecycle renders one immutable `ProcessGuid` across Event 1,
  Event 5, DNS, network, file, registry, module, process-access, and remote-thread projections.
- **Entry paths:** direct process create/terminate, long-running baseline services, PID 4 dependent
  activity, parent-before-child timing repair, dropped Event 1 collection, checkpointed batches, and
  compatibility rendering.
- **Consumers:** Sysmon lifecycle joins, eCAR-to-Sysmon process correlation, parent GUIDs, evaluator
  causality checks, detection process graphs, and blind endpoint review.
- **Layer rationale:** `ProcessGuid` encodes the visible Event 1 anchor. A parent-order repair changed
  that anchor only in an instance-local cache, allowing later events to recover the unrepaired
  host-shared value. The repaired anchor must be published by the timing owner, not rewritten by an
  emitter.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve native versus provider-envelope timestamps, PID reuse isolation,
  cross-source Security 4688 ordering, parent identity, collection-dropped creates, cache retention,
  checkpoint recovery, and deterministic replay.

### Result

- Parent-order repairs now update the host-shared Sysmon create anchor, and dependent renderers
  prefer the durable canonical actor over a thinner same-PID process carrier.
- The definitive hard probe joined 759 visible create/terminate lifecycles with zero ProcessGuid
  mismatches. All seven hosts with PID 4 evidence retained one GUID.
- Focused Sysmon tests passed twice while closing the discovered PID 4 sibling. The final routine
  suite passed 8,208 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff lint and format
  checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation remained 95.8512 across 110,715 records, with temporal integrity as the only
  failed hard gate.
- Blind scores were 84, 84, 76, and 78 (average 80.5; spread 8), all Synthetic. No deliberation was
  required, and no reviewer repeated the immutable ProcessGuid contradiction.
- Two reviewers independently retained ASA connection-ID chronology as a dataset-wide defect; it
  is the next highest-leverage repeated source-native family.

## Assessment loop 44 — ASA connection-ID chronology

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** the ASA source finalizer over the appliance's timestamp-sorted build and
  teardown stream.
- **Invariant:** each appliance allocates one unique, monotonically increasing connection ID when a
  built record enters final source chronology, and every teardown retains that exact ID.
- **Entry paths:** baseline and storyline permits, TCP and UDP, NAT and identity-NAT paths, retries,
  external sorted runs, incremental checkpoints, output-target year partitioning, and final close.
- **Consumers:** ASA 302013/302014 and 302015/302016 joins, firewall hunting pivots, SIEM sequence
  analytics, deterministic parsers, and blind network/detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical connection identity is generation-order truth, while an ASA counter
  is source-local runtime order. The latter cannot be finalized until the appliance's rows are
  globally sorted, so the source finalizer owns allocation and pair-preserving projection.
- **Sibling risks:** retain build/teardown pairing across year-split files, deterministic retry,
  atomic replacement, multiple appliance lanes, NAT companion ordering, explicit deny records,
  checkpoint-restored runs, and byte-identical repeated close.

### Result

- Canonical ASA permits now receive appliance-local IDs only after the definitive source stream is
  timestamp sorted. Raw caller-supplied records remain byte-faithful, and teardown rows retain their
  build ID through atomic finalization.
- The hard probe inspected 6,751 generated build/teardown lifecycles: build IDs were unique and
  strictly consecutive, with zero orphaned build or teardown references.
- Focused ASA, output-target, and constructor-bypass compatibility tests passed. The final routine
  suite passed 8,208 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff lint and format
  checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation remained 95.8512 across 110,715 records, with temporal integrity as the only
  failed hard gate.
- Blind scores were 72, 84, 67, and 78 (average 75.25; spread 17), all Synthetic. No deliberation
  was required, and no reviewer repeated the backward ASA connection-ID defect.
- Two reviewers independently prioritized operation-detached one-shot command lifetimes and
  millisecond-scale retirement sweeps; this is the next family for loop 45.

## Assessment loop 45 — operation-owned SMB client lifetime

### Finding classification

- Direct `smbclient -c` processes surviving completed SMB transports by tens of minutes or hours:
  `new_family`, independently confirmed by threat-hunting and host-forensics review.
- Millisecond-scale retirement sweeps: `same_family_sibling`; these are the delayed consequence of
  leaving bounded operation processes in live State until a later stale/session drain.
- Other bounded utilities (`git log`, `head`, and `cmd.exe /c`) with delayed exits:
  `same_family_sibling`, retained for the hard probe and follow-on expansion if the SMB owner fix
  does not remove their common lifecycle cause.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** the canonical SMB action bundle and its resolved client-process plan.
- **Invariant:** a process profile marked as operation-lived remains active through its SMB
  transport and file effects, then terminates independently within bounded jitter after transport
  close; session-lived clients such as Explorer and mounted-kernel transport remain unaffected.
- **Entry paths:** direct Linux `smbclient`, Windows-native access, mounted CIFS operations,
  downloads, uploads, remote copies, multi-file channel reuse, denied operations, storyline and
  baseline actions, and explicit preferred process ownership.
- **Consumers:** client eCAR process lifecycle, endpoint FLOW actor joins, SMB source file effects,
  Zeek transport close, session teardown, stale-process cleanup, shell serialization, and blind
  host/threat review.
- **Layer rationale:** executable lifetime is an action-bundle fact because only the SMB owner knows
  both the profile's lifecycle class and the definitive transport/file completion frontier. A
  generic hourly drain sees the process but not the completed operation it should follow.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve source-process visibility through every dependent effect, do not
  terminate persistent Explorer or mounted transport owners, keep client and server processes
  distinct, respect authoritative session deadlines and collection bounds, and retain exact retry
  behavior for persistent SMB publication.

### Result

- Operation-lived SMB clients now close after definitive publication, bounded foreground
  finalizers run before their hourly watermark, and eCAR process termination remains governed by
  the process's own dependent frontier rather than unrelated later session activity.
- The hard probe joined 26 direct `smbclient -c` lifecycles with zero missing or duplicate endpoint
  events, zero lifetimes over 60 seconds, and a 43.018-second maximum.
- Focused source-timing and process-lifecycle tests passed. The final routine suite passed 8,211
  tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff lint and format checks passed
  across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation improved to 96.2822 across 123,124 records, and every hard acceptance gate
  passed.
- Initial blind scores were 43, 78, 72, and 84 (average 69.25; spread 41), with one Inconclusive
  and three Synthetic verdicts. Deliberation revised all four to Synthetic with an average score
  of 87.25. No reviewer repeated the SMB lifetime defect.
- The next highest-impact independent contradiction is positive duration on unanswered one-packet
  ICMP scan flows; this becomes the loop-46 family.

## Assessment loop 46 — ICMP packet-observation semantics

### Finding classification

- Positive Zeek duration on unanswered one-packet ICMP probes: `new_family`, confirmed as a hard
  contradiction by the loop-45 network reviewer and accepted by all four reviewers in deliberation.
- Scan-only `service:icmp`: `same_family_sibling`; Zeek analyzer service inference must not depend
  on whether ICMP came from a scanner or baseline ping.
- Independently varied echo payload size per target in one discovery sweep: `same_family_sibling`;
  invocation-level scanner settings should remain stable across targets.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical ICMP transaction planning for invocation-level request shape,
  followed by the Zeek conn renderer for packet-observed duration and analyzer service semantics.
- **Invariant:** a one-packet ICMP observation has no positive first-to-last-packet duration; ICMP
  does not claim a Zeek analyzer service; one nmap discovery invocation retains one payload size.
- **Entry paths:** baseline ping, nmap discovery, modeled and unmodeled responders, multi-sensor
  projection, storyline connection, direct compatibility generation, and collection boundaries.
- **Consumers:** Zeek conn, ASA ICMP lifecycle, IDS tuple correlation, network evaluation, and blind
  network/detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical planning owns the scanner's shared invocation parameters and
  internal timeout interval, while only the Zeek renderer owns what packet capture can calculate
  from actually observed packets.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve canonical timeout/state closure, responding RTTs, packet and byte
  accounting, sensor-local loss, tuple/UID correlation, IDS timing, and non-ICMP service inference.

### Result

- Zeek conn projection now omits duration when the sensor observed only one packet, and ICMP rows
  no longer claim an analyzer service. Explicit ICMP payload sizes remain exact, allowing one nmap
  discovery invocation to retain one request shape across its targets.
- The hard probe inspected 725 ICMP rows: all 489 one-packet observations omitted duration, all 725
  omitted service, and the 254-target discovery sweep used one 64-byte payload size.
- Focused Zeek observation, format, multiplexing, ICMP-accounting, and exact slow nmap tests passed.
  The final routine suite passed 8,213 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; Ruff passed across
  753 files.
- Automated evaluation improved to 96.4266 across 120,631 records, with every hard gate passing.
- Blind scores were 64, 69, 68, and 76 (average 69.25; spread 12), all Synthetic. No deliberation
  was required, and no reviewer repeated the ICMP family defect.
- The next highest-impact repeated hard contradiction is ordinary user Explorers parented by
  `services.exe`, together with repeated desktop bootstraps under unchanged logon IDs.

## Assessment loop 47 — historical Windows desktop-shell ownership

### Finding classification

- Ordinary user `explorer.exe` processes parented by `services.exe`: `existing_family_regression`,
  reproduced 17 times across five workstations by the loop-46 host reviewer.
- Repeated `userinit.exe`/Explorer bootstrap chains under one unchanged interactive Logon ID:
  `same_family_sibling`; future-dated teardown removes the original shell from the mutable live map
  even while its retained identity still spans the earlier activity timestamp.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical Windows session/process interval state and the Explorer
  reuse/parent-resolution boundary.
- **Invariant:** one interactive Logon ID owns one initial `winlogon.exe` → `userinit.exe` →
  `explorer.exe` bootstrap. Any later activity whose canonical timestamp falls inside that Explorer
  identity's retained lifetime reuses the same shell identity; it must not emit another bootstrap
  or create an ordinary user's Explorer beneath a service process.
- **Entry paths:** Type 2/10/11 session bootstrap, baseline `process_system` selection, GUI-parent
  resolution, late-planned activity evaluated before an eagerly applied logoff, explicit process
  requests, and genuine post-termination shell repair.
- **Consumers:** StateManager process identities, Windows 4688, Sysmon 1/5, eCAR PROCESS and
  dependent actor joins, parent-image lookup, user-process history, and blind host/detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** the original start/end interval is already canonical truth. The defect comes
  from treating absence in a mutable live map as absence at an earlier event timestamp, so the fix
  belongs in temporal process lookup and reuse rather than in any Windows emitter.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve genuine shell repair after the recorded end, source-visible parent
  ordering, retained parent snapshots for GUI children, PID-reuse identity isolation, network and
  service logons that cannot own desktops, and deterministic out-of-order planning.

### Result

- Native SMB reuse no longer reclassifies a resident Explorer as operation-lived, and SMB process
  attachment now requires a currently mutable session. Exact SSH publication also accepts valid
  partial source observation when either eCAR or Syslog is independently dropped.
- The hard probe found 14 Explorer creates, zero `services.exe` parents, zero duplicate bare
  Explorers per session, and zero duplicate `userinit.exe` bootstraps per session.
- Focused SMB/session/SSH tests passed. The final routine suite passed 8,218 tests with 5 skipped
  and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff lint and format checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation scored 96.2468 across 114,409 records, with all hard gates passing.
- Initial blind scores were 52, 75, 62, and 74 (average 65.75), with one Inconclusive and three
  Synthetic verdicts. Required deliberation revised all four to Synthetic at 73, 84, 77, and 80
  (average 78.5). No reviewer repeated the desktop-shell defect.
- The next hard contradiction is a Security 4688 child visibly preceding its exact parent after
  source timing; this becomes the loop-48 family.

## Assessment loop 48 — Windows source-local process ancestry timing

### Finding classification

- FILE-SRV-01 Security 4688 `userinit.exe` preceding its exact `winlogon.exe` parent by 223 ms:
  `new_family`, a same-channel hard contradiction independently accepted by every reviewer during
  deliberation.
- Remote-session parent image/command loss despite visible exact parent identity:
  `same_family_sibling`; canonical ancestry exists, but late construction and finalized source
  timing can prevent the source-native fields from carrying it.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** `SourceTimingPlanner` process-create timing for Windows Security,
  coordinated with canonical `ProcessIdentity` ancestry.
- **Invariant:** for every source-visible Security 4688 parent/child pair, the parent's rendered
  create precedes the child's rendered create. Finalized source timing must enforce this directly
  and must not rely on an emitter post-fixup that is forbidden to move finalized rows.
- **Entry paths:** local interactive and remote-interactive shell bootstraps, ordinary user process
  creation, service children, baseline and storyline process generation, retained parent identity,
  and collection-delayed endpoint projection.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security 4688 ordering and parent fields, Sysmon Event 1 ancestry, eCAR
  process joins, process termination floors, deterministic evaluation, and blind host/detection
  review.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical ancestry is correct and Sysmon renders the pair in order; only the
  Windows Security source clock independently places the two rows incorrectly. The source timing
  owner must therefore constrain the final source-native observations before rendering.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve Security-after-Sysmon latency, stable per-process source timestamps,
  parent recursion without cycles, PID-reuse isolation, collection missingness, process-close
  dependents, and deterministic timing audit behavior.

### Result

- `SourceTimingPlanner` now recursively fixes each visible Windows Security parent's source time
  before its child and records the adjustment in the timing audit relationship.
- The hard probe joined 188 source-visible parent/child pairs with zero inversions.
- Focused tests passed. The routine suite passed 8,219 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003 deselected;
  repository-wide Ruff lint and format checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation scored 96.2468 across 114,409 records, with all hard gates passing.
- Initial blind scores were 29, 68, 38, and 69 (average 51; spread 40), with Real, Synthetic,
  Inconclusive, and Synthetic verdicts. Required deliberation revised all four to Synthetic at 68,
  74, 67, and 75 (average 71). No reviewer repeated the ancestry-timing inversion.
- The next highest-impact repeated source-native defect is the malformed SMB Type 3 authentication
  family; this becomes loop 49.

## Assessment loop 49 — Windows SMB network-logon identity

### Finding classification

- 151 successful Type 3 logons with empty subject, GUID, logon-process, and LM-package fields:
  `new_family`, repeated across DC-01, DC-02, and FILE-SRV-01.
- Receiver-owned `WorkstationName` on those same records: `same_family_sibling`; modeled client
  identity exists but is not carried into the logon occurrence.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** the canonical SMB action bundle's accepted authentication occurrence and
  durable SMB session identity.
- **Invariant:** each modeled Windows SMB acceptance renders one source-native Type 3 logon whose
  SYSTEM subject, client workstation, authentication process/package, target SID, LUID, and GUID
  are derived from the same canonical client/session truth used by transport and SMB effects.
- **Entry paths:** persistent and one-shot SMB channels, Kerberos and NTLMSSP authentication,
  Windows-native clients, Linux clients reaching Windows servers, baseline and storyline actions,
  denied operations, channel reuse, and modeled or unavailable client hosts.
- **Consumers:** Security 4624/4634, Sysmon/eCAR session joins, SMB tree/file auditing, transport
  correlation, detection rules, deterministic evaluation, and blind host/detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** the SMB action bundle owns the accepted protocol session, source endpoint,
  authentication mechanism, and durable session identity before rendering. Emitters must project
  that complete canonical truth rather than infer missing ownership from the destination host.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve Samba-native authentication semantics, fixed-principal SMB use,
  client-process ownership, session reuse and close timing, source-port correlation, null-GUID
  policy, denied-auth behavior, and collection missingness.

### Result

- The persistent SMB owner now projects complete SYSTEM subject, client workstation, protocol-
  specific authentication, target SID/LUID/GUID, and LSASS reporter identity into Type 3 logons.
- The hard probe inspected all 433 Type 3 logons: every required field was populated, no remote
  record named its receiver as the workstation, and only coherent Kerberos and NTLM combinations
  remained.
- Focused production tests passed. The routine suite passed 8,220 tests with 5 skipped and 2,003
  deselected; Ruff lint and format checks passed across 753 files.
- Automated evaluation improved to 96.2686 across 114,409 records, with all hard gates passing.
- All four blind verdicts were Synthetic at 84, 66, 86, and 84 (average 80; spread 20), so no
  deliberation was required. No reviewer repeated the prior SMB blank-field/receiver signature.
- The next repeated cross-source contradiction is the RDP login identity, process ancestry,
  terminal-session, and initializer-lifetime family; this becomes loop 50.

## Assessment loop 50 — RDP login and desktop-bootstrap identity

### Finding classification

- Empty Type 10 target SID/GUID and SYSTEM creator fields: `new_family`, repeated for all four
  visible RDP sessions.
- Missing parent images and wrong parent principals across RDP process triplets:
  `same_family_sibling`, despite exact parent process identities already existing canonically.
- Session-0 `winlogon.exe`: `same_family_sibling`; terminal-session projection incorrectly follows
  SYSTEM-account defaults despite an explicit nonzero RDP terminal session.
- Session-long RDP `userinit.exe`: `adjacent_family`, reserved for a dedicated early process-close
  loop because it requires a distinct lifecycle transition before disconnect.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** the deferred RDP action bundle's initial-session materialization batch and
  dependent occurrence projection.
- **Invariant:** one successful RDP session carries one immutable target SID/LUID/GUID and terminal
  session ID through its 4624, `winlogon.exe`, `userinit.exe`, and Explorer evidence. Canonical
  parent snapshots populate every source regardless of the owning account's privilege class.
- **Entry paths:** RDP to workstation, member server, file server, and domain controller; local and
  remote source hosts; elevated and standard users; reconnect, bounded-window, observation-drop,
  exact-publication retry, and collection-boundary paths.
- **Consumers:** Security 4624/4688/4689/4634/4779, Sysmon 1/5, eCAR process/session telemetry,
  process and session registries, source timing, reconnect state, evaluation, and blind
  detection/host review.
- **Layer rationale:** the deferred RDP owner already allocates the complete session and bootstrap
  process graph atomically. Identity, ancestry, and terminal session must be attached there before
  source-native renderers consume the graph.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve SYSTEM token ownership for `winlogon.exe`, user token ownership for
  `userinit.exe` and Explorer, parent-before-child source ordering, reconnect continuity, exact
  recovery, and end-window omission.

### Result

- Commit `a99cd68a4` makes deferred RDP login and bootstrap identity complete before source
  projection: Type 10 logons receive canonical SID/GUID values, bootstrap processes carry their
  frozen parent snapshots, and explicit nonzero terminal sessions override SYSTEM defaults.
- The focused 63-test exact RDP production module and the full routine suite passed (8,220 passed,
  5 skipped, 2,003 deselected); Ruff check and format gates passed.
- Supported generation produced 114,409 records. The hard probe found four complete Type 10
  sessions, four nonempty target SIDs/GUIDs, twelve correct bootstrap parent rows, and four
  triplets with one shared nonzero terminal-session ID.
- Automated evaluation scored 96.2705 with all hard gates passing.
- The fresh blind panel returned four Synthetic verdicts with synthetic-confidence scores 74,
  86, 58, and 74 (average 73; spread 28). No deliberation was required.
- The eCAR Teams post-termination module-load contradiction repeated from loop 49 at P0 and
  becomes loop 51.

## Assessment loop 51 — process-dependent evidence before terminalization

### Finding classification

- Six eCAR `MODULE/LOAD` rows for one Teams utility process occur after the same durable process
  object's eCAR `PROCESS/TERMINATE`: `same_family_sibling`, repeated in loops 49 and 50.
- Sysmon observes the same process lifecycle without post-termination dependents, localizing the
  defect to source-local eCAR timing/finalization rather than process identity allocation.
- Other process-dependent families (flow, file, registry, process access, remote thread) share the
  same terminal-ordering risk and are included as sibling paths.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** action-cohort source timing and the process lifecycle authority that
  freezes source-visible dependent frontiers before process termination publication.
- **Invariant:** for each durable process identity in one source, every visible dependent record
  must render at or after its visible create and no later than its visible terminate. A terminal
  projection must wait for the latest source-local dependent frontier; it must never rewrite a
  dependent timestamp in an emitter.
- **Entry paths:** baseline application launches, storyline processes, nested process trees,
  foreground and background applications, short-lived processes, process/network and
  process/file bundles, observation delay/drop, bounded-window, exact retry, and session drain.
- **Consumers:** eCAR process/module/flow/file/registry/process-access/thread evidence, Sysmon
  process/dependent/terminate evidence, Security process audit, lifecycle registry, source timing,
  evaluation, and blind endpoint/detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** the canonical process graph is correct and Sysmon already respects it. The
  shared source-timing/finalization owner must enforce source-local dependent-before-terminal
  ordering before renderers consume immutable projections.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve canonical timestamps, cross-source latency texture, process GUID and
  object identity, parent/child close barriers, observation-cohort coherence, retry neutrality,
  collection-boundary omission, and bounded retained state.

### Result

- Commit `983a45cbf` removes the accidental Sysmon-style re-keying of eCAR process lifecycle
  timing, so source-local dependents and terminalization now share the canonical process object.
- Focused source-timing and eCAR integration suites passed (73 and 137 tests), followed by the
  full routine gate (8,221 passed, 5 skipped, 2,003 deselected) and clean Ruff gates.
- Supported generation produced 114,409 records. Across 32,914 eCAR rows, the hard probe found
  19,765 process-attributed dependents with zero before create and zero after terminate. The cited
  Teams object now terminates 5 ms after its last startup module.
- Automated evaluation remained 96.2705 with every hard gate passing.
- Initial blind verdicts were three Synthetic and one Real at 63, 56, 24, and 68 (average 52.75;
  spread 44). Required deliberation ended at three Synthetic and one Inconclusive, with scores 71,
  67, 45, and 75 (average 64.5).
- The panel ranked successful proxy-upload payload non-conservation as its strongest remaining
  shared-truth defect; this becomes loop 52.

## Assessment loop 52 — explicit proxy upload payload conservation

### Finding classification

- A successful multipart upload carries approximately 44 MB on the client-to-proxy leg but only
  18.8 MB on the proxy-to-origin leg, with zero reported loss: `same_family_sibling` in the
  explicit proxy transaction's shared transfer accounting.
- Proxy access and ASA independently corroborate the contradictory totals on both legs, making
  this a four-source transaction contract rather than a single-renderer formatting defect.
- Download accounting, cache/deny behavior, and direct HTTP transfers are sibling paths whose
  existing semantics must remain unchanged.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** the explicit proxy transaction action bundle and its immutable transfer
  accounting carried into both canonical network legs.
- **Invariant:** one successful forwarded request has one canonical request-body truth. Client
  upload, proxy ingress, proxy access, proxy egress, origin request, and firewall observations may
  add separately modeled framing/transport overhead, but their decoded payload cannot diverge.
  Transformations, retries, truncation, denial, and capture loss require explicit outcomes.
- **Entry paths:** cleartext HTTP and CONNECT/TLS proxying; GET/POST/PUT; multipart and raw body;
  upload/download; keep-alive/tunnel reuse; cache hit/miss; deny/auth/error; partial capture;
  observation delay/drop; exact retry; and collection boundaries.
- **Consumers:** client/proxy eCAR FLOW and FILE evidence, proxy access logs, Zeek conn/http/files,
  ASA build/teardown accounting, IDS, transfer evaluation, storyline reconciliation, and blind
  threat/network review.
- **Layer rationale:** the proxy bundle owns both transport legs and the logical request before any
  source renderer. Payload size must be computed once there and carried to every consumer; no
  emitter may independently invent a successful leg's body volume.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve directional overhead, TLS framing, packet counts, loss accounting,
  response bytes, tunnel reuse, multiple requests per connection, file hashes/FUIDs, proxy status,
  deterministic identity, and bounded runtime state.

### Result

- Commit `58efa45c4` replaces stale generator-owned upload estimates at the proxy transaction
  boundary while preserving the already-planned source-side overhead around the canonical HTTP
  entity body.
- The focused proxy suite passed 105 tests. The routine suite passed 8,222 tests with 5 skipped
  and 2,003 deselected; repository-wide Ruff lint and format checks passed across 753 files.
- Supported generation produced 114,409 records. The authored 18,782,613-byte multipart body is
  conserved on both proxy legs with zero capture loss; the prior approximately 44 MB client leg
  no longer exists.
- Automated evaluation scored 96.2705 with every hard gate passing.
- Initial blind verdicts were Real, Synthetic, Synthetic, and Synthetic at 32, 78, 84, and 93.
  Required deliberation ended unanimously Synthetic at 79, 91, 92, and 96.
- The panel's strongest remaining hard family is IDS alert identity and encrypted-content
  visibility; this becomes loop 53.

## Assessment loop 53 — IDS observable-trigger ownership

### Finding classification

- Five `curl` User-Agent alerts contradict the sole Zeek HTTP transaction on their tuples, which
  renders Go or Wget instead: `new_family`, repeated across five perimeter observations.
- One APT User-Agent alert contradicts a Go client and two Python-urllib content alerts are
  attached to TLS-only origin flows without visible decryption: `same_family_sibling` visibility
  and trigger-identity failures.
- IDS latency texture is adjacent timing work and is reserved unless the trigger owner also proves
  responsible for it.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical IDS assertion planning attached to the network/application
  occurrence that owns the observable trigger and sensor visibility.
- **Invariant:** every content-specific IDS alert is derived from the exact source-visible payload
  field rendered for that tuple. Encrypted traffic may carry content alerts only at a modeled
  decryption observation point; otherwise assertions must use TLS-visible facts.
- **Entry paths:** built-in and authored alerts; direct cleartext HTTP; explicit-proxy decrypted
  HTTP; CONNECT passthrough and inspected TLS; origin-side TLS; User-Agent, URI, referrer, DNS,
  JA3/TLS, threshold, and generic flow rules; multi-sensor routing; observation drop/delay; and
  exact retry.
- **Consumers:** Snort/Suricata rendering, Zeek HTTP/SSL/conn, proxy access, IDS correlation
  evaluation, sensor visibility, detections, and blind network/detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** only canonical application and visibility planning knows both the exact
  trigger value and whether a sensor can observe it. Signature names must not be selected
  independently in an emitter or baseline pool.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve authored positive assertions, no-alert controls, DNS/TLS signature
  semantics, packet-direction and tuple identity, proxy ingress versus origin egress, alert
  timestamps, sensor-local filtering, deterministic signature selection, and duplicate
  suppression.

### Result

- Commit `55dec82c0` adds exact HTTP User-Agent predicates, derives baseline HTTP evidence from the
  same signature truth, and excludes plaintext Python-urllib assertions from opaque TLS baselines.
- Focused IDS tests and all 93 config validations passed; the routine suite passed 8,224 tests with
  5 skipped and 2,003 deselected; Ruff gates passed.
- Generation produced 114,286 records. Five curl and two APT alerts match their exact Zeek HTTP
  values; zero Python-urllib content alerts remain on opaque TLS. Evaluation passed at 96.1232.
- Initial blind scores were 55, 78, 68, and 61. Deliberation ended unanimously Synthetic at 74,
  84, 81, and 76.
- The strongest new positive contradiction is HTTP error response artifact ownership; this becomes
  loop 54.

## Assessment loop 54 — HTTP terminal response artifact ownership

### Finding classification

- A 403 Citrix installer request renders a fully observed 1,474-byte PE with matching hash and
  detailed PE analysis at two sensors: `new_family`, a terminal-outcome/content contradiction.
- Error MIME, file transfer, hash, and analyzer projection are `same_family_sibling` consumers of
  the same response artifact.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical HTTP response terminal outcome and response-artifact builder.
- **Invariant:** status, body size, MIME, file identity, hash, and analyzer metadata describe one
  response body. Error outcomes cannot retain requested-success PE identity unless the authored
  error body is independently modeled as that executable.
- **Entry paths:** direct and proxied HTTP/HTTPS; success, redirect, 304, 403, 407, and 5xx; GET and
  download responses; multi-sensor projection; capture loss; cache outcomes; and explicit files.
- **Consumers:** Zeek HTTP/files/PE, proxy access, connection bytes, hashes, IDS content rules,
  evaluation, and blind network/detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** terminal HTTP planning owns the response before file/analyzer companions are
  created. Renderers must consume that frozen response artifact.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve successful downloads, partial captures, FUID locality, hash agreement,
  MIME normalization, redirects/HEAD/304 bodylessness, proxy error templates, and deterministic
  multi-sensor identity.

### Result

- Commits `536ee7ad9` and `928f24929` bind proxied HTTP artifacts to the terminal outcome and
  sanitize download-scale MIME on error responses at canonical HTTP normalization.
- Focused HTTP/proxy tests passed, followed by 8,225 routine tests with 5 skipped and 2,003
  deselected; repository-wide Ruff lint and format checks passed.
- Supported generation produced 114,284 records. Both Zeek sensors render the denied Citrix
  response as a 1,474-byte `text/html` file, and neither emits a PE companion for its response
  FUID. Automated evaluation remained 96.1232 with every hard gate passing.
- Initial blind verdicts were one Real and three Synthetic. Required deliberation ended unanimously
  Synthetic with an average 94.25 verdict confidence and mean realism score of 62.
- The panel ranked SCP-to-SMB physical availability, byte causality, and file provenance as the
  strongest remaining defect; this becomes loop 55.

## Assessment loop 55 — chained file-transfer lifecycle ownership

### Finding classification

- A complete 794,475-byte archive is relayed over SMB before its upstream SCP flow could have
  delivered it, while that flow carries only 30,675 originator payload bytes: `new_family`, a hard
  physical-causality failure.
- The APP receive object changes identity before its local read, loses actor/PID ownership, and the
  replacement identity is reused on the destination: `same_family_sibling` provenance failures.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** canonical file-transfer action lifecycle and its immutable artifact
  lineage, composed across SCP reception and dependent SMB transfer.
- **Invariant:** a dependent transfer may consume an artifact only after the upstream transfer has
  made the required bytes available. Transport payload must cover the transferred object plus
  modeled protocol overhead; each host-local file version keeps stable identity and process
  ownership, with explicit lineage linking copies across hosts.
- **Entry paths:** SCP and SFTP receive/send; SMB client/server copy; chained transfers; full and
  partial files; compressed content; success, failure, interruption, and retry; direct and mounted
  clients; observation delay/drop; multi-sensor visibility; and collection boundaries.
- **Consumers:** source/destination eCAR FILE and FLOW, SSH/PAM/syslog, Zeek conn/files/SMB,
  Samba audit, hashes/FUIDs, transfer reconciliation, evaluation, and blind incident/hunt review.
- **Layer rationale:** only the transfer lifecycle owns object availability, byte completion, and
  derivation before network and endpoint projections split. Timing or identity must not be patched
  independently in an emitter or downstream storyline event.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve streamable transfers, encryption overhead, independent sensor timing,
  local versus remote object authority, source process lifetime, content hashes, file sizes,
  destination service identity, retry neutrality, and bounded retained state.

### Result

- Commits `372ad0e2b`, `0ee1c37dd`, `9843b327c`, `4acf035a2`, `ac3bda9e2`, and
  `a09169084` move SCP completion and receiver-placement identity into the canonical transfer
  lifecycle, then hand that exact artifact to the dependent SMB action even when no runtime
  artifact registry is installed.
- Focused SCP, SMB, and storyline tests passed (157 tests), followed by the routine suite (8,228
  passed, 5 skipped, 2,003 deselected) and clean Ruff gates.
- Generation produced 114,250 evaluated records. The 823,965-byte archive is covered by 833,491
  SCP originator bytes and 826,794 SMB originator bytes; SCP closes before SMB starts, and the APP
  receiver's create/read preserve object `0c591283-7383-4f9b-9575-a5abc466dcd9`.
- Automated evaluation passed at 96.1262. Initial blind scores were 65, 72, 30, and 74. Required
  deliberation retained a 3-1 Synthetic majority at 76, 82, 44, and 82.
- The panel ranked the repeated Type-10 RDP process identity, ordering, parentage, and userinit
  lifetime contradictions first; this becomes loop 56.

## Assessment loop 56 — exact RDP bootstrap identity and lifecycle

### Finding classification

- All four visible Type-10 logons name a different ProcessId than their session winlogon; three
  logons render before that process, and two overlapping sessions reuse one caller PID:
  `same_family_sibling`, a repeated hard RDP identity and ordering contradiction.
- Every RDP winlogon is parented directly by System and four userinit processes survive for 30
  minutes to 2.7 hours: `same_family_sibling` bootstrap-parent and child-lifetime defects.

### Family contract

- **Owning abstraction:** the exact RDP session action bundle, its deferred session materialization
  graph, and the shared source-timing cohort for bootstrap dependents.
- **Invariant:** one Type-10 session owns one distinct winlogon identity created through the
  host's live smss process before authentication; 4624 names that exact PID. Userinit is a
  short-lived bootstrap child that terminates seconds after launching explorer, independently of
  the RDP session or desktop lifetime.
- **Entry paths:** first RDP logon, overlapping sessions, reconnect/disconnect/logoff, modeled and
  unmodeled clients, elevated and ordinary users, source observation delay/drop, collection
  boundaries, exact publication recovery, and compatibility paths.
- **Consumers:** Security 4624/4688/4689, Sysmon 1/5, eCAR PROCESS and USER_SESSION, State session
  role links, RDP application state, lifecycle finalizers, source timing, and blind host/detection
  review.
- **Layer rationale:** the RDP bundle allocates the session and bootstrap graph before renderers
  see it. It must attach the exact winlogon identity to authentication and assign parent/lifetime
  semantics before source-specific timing and rendering split.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve transport-before-auth, per-session PID/GUID uniqueness, local Type-2
  behavior, reconnect reuse, explorer/session lifetime, parent visibility, observation-cohort
  integrity, exact retry neutrality, and bounded terminal state.

### Result

- Commit `1597c6436` gives each deferred Type-10 authentication canonical headroom after its exact
  session winlogon, resolves 4624 caller identity from that session-specific process, and parents
  RDP winlogon through the live target `smss.exe` when available.
- Two slow production-path tests and 258 focused routine tests passed. The full routine suite
  passed 8,228 tests with 5 skipped and 2,004 deselected; Ruff lint and format checks passed across
  753 files.
- Supported generation produced 114,255 records. The hard probe found four exact 4624-to-winlogon
  PID matches, four process-before-logon orderings, distinct PIDs for overlapping sessions, and
  `smss.exe` parentage on every RDP winlogon.
- Automated evaluation passed at 96.1263, with all four pillars above 93. Initial blind scores were
  86, 54, 74, and 74. Required calibration ended unanimously Synthetic at 88, 76, 81, and 82.
- The repaired PID/order family held under blind review. The panel's strongest adjacent findings
  are RDP `ParentUser`/`userinit.exe` lifecycle, DHCP timestamp and completion semantics,
  per-sensor DNS RTT ownership, and TLS analyzer lifecycle coverage. These are retained as the
  prioritized starting findings for a future loop rather than extending this 15-loop run.
