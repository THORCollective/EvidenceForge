# Iteration-Test Assessment — Loops 57–75

## Scope

- Branch: `codex/assess-20-loops-2026-09-10`, created from `dev` at `12988ce72`.
- Originally requested loops: 57 through 76, using `scenarios/iteration-test/scenario.yaml`.
- The user ended the run after loop 75, so the completed restarted session contains 19 loops
  (57 through 75); loop 76 was not started.
- Prior loop-57 work was explicitly discarded and is not part of this effort.
- Every loop will preserve standalone four-reviewer blind scoring and automated evaluation.

## Loop 57 Family Contract

### DHCP source-local phase timing

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-56 `sibling_defect` in the DHCP action family.
- **Owning abstraction:** `DhcpLeaseActionBundle` owns transaction phases; the shared timing runtime owns deterministic source-observation variation.
- **Invariant:** endpoint `DHCPREQUEST`, `DHCPACK`, and bound records are independently timed, remain causally ordered, share one source-local observation decision, and keep ACK observation close to the canonical network transaction close without copying one timestamp's microsecond suffix.
- **Entry paths:** baseline initial acquisition and renewal scheduling, direct activity-generator requests, and any storyline/compatibility caller using `generate_dhcp_lease`.
- **Consumers:** Zeek DHCP, Linux syslog, network transaction state, deterministic eval, and blind timing review.
- **Layer rationale:** phase relationships belong to the DHCP bundle; emitter-only jitter would duplicate truth and could disagree with the canonical close.
- **Sibling risks:** acquisition and renewal are both covered. Per-sensor DNS RTT remains a separate source-timing family.

### Canonical process-parent principal

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-56 `sibling_defect` in canonical process ancestry.
- **Owning abstraction:** `ProcessContext` and exact deferred process materialization own parent identity; Sysmon renders that truth.
- **Invariant:** when an exact parent identity is available, every child process projection can render the parent's principal independently of whether mutable live state still contains the parent.
- **Entry paths:** deferred RDP session process publication and ordinary state-backed Windows session process creation; legacy/raw callers retain source-native fallback behavior.
- **Consumers:** Sysmon Event 1, eCAR process relationships, Security 4688, source-timing parent identity, and process-tree probes.
- **Layer rationale:** eCAR already proves the parent principal exists canonically; teaching only Sysmon about RDP would patch a rendered symptom.
- **Sibling risks:** RDP `userinit.exe` lifetime is not changed in this loop because exact process terminalization currently requires child-before-parent closure.

- Rendered process probe: all 23 `userinit.exe` rows identify `winlogon.exe` as an
  `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` parent; no resolvable Sysmon parent-principal mismatch remains.
- Blind panel: initial scores 44/65/83/84 (mean 69.00); verdict disagreement and
  40-point spread triggered deliberation. Final scores 74/80/87/88 (mean 82.25),
  unanimously Synthetic.
- Next highest-impact families: packet-owned UDP DNS close timing and short-lived
  RDP `userinit.exe` terminalization.

## Loop 58 Family Contract

### Packet-owned UDP DNS close timing

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-57 `sibling_defect` in the canonical
  network-transaction family.
- **Owning abstraction:** `NetworkTransactionPlanner` owns DNS packet accounting,
  response RTT, and canonical transport close duration.
- **Invariant:** a response-bearing UDP DNS transaction whose `Dd` history proves
  one request and one response closes after the response plus only the modeled DNS
  close slack; a generic caller duration cannot create an unexplained idle tail.
- **Entry paths:** explicit `DnsContext` requests, hostname-synthesized DNS context,
  baseline resolver traffic, and compatibility callers using `generate_connection`.
- **Consumers:** Zeek `conn.log` and `dns.log`, source-timing constraints, canonical
  network state, deterministic evaluation, and blind packet-accounting review.
- **Layer rationale:** the canonical network transaction owns packet and close truth;
  changing only Zeek rendering would leave state and sibling consumers inconsistent.
- **Sibling risks:** TCP DNS and unanswered DNS retain their protocol-specific close
  behavior; response-bearing synthesized UDP DNS is the bounded target.

### Short-lived RDP session initializer

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-57 `sibling_defect` in the exact RDP
  lifecycle family.
- **Owning abstraction:** `RdpSessionActionBundle` and its authenticated exact
  lifecycle continuation own target process creation and termination.
- **Invariant:** initial Type 10 sessions terminate `userinit.exe` shortly after
  `explorer.exe` is ready, independently of the interactive session and transport
  close, while preserving the canonical winlogon -> userinit -> explorer ancestry.
- **Entry paths:** exact initial RDP publication and its continuation recovery path;
  reconnects do not create or terminate another session initializer.
- **Consumers:** state lifecycle, Windows Security 4688/4689, Sysmon 1/5, eCAR
  PROCESS CREATE/TERMINATE, and final RDP session teardown.
- **Layer rationale:** early initializer exit is lifecycle truth shared by every
  endpoint projection; emitter-specific terminal rows would orphan canonical state.
- **Sibling risks:** `winlogon.exe` and `explorer.exe` remain session-lived, and final
  teardown must naturally exclude the already-closed initializer.

## Loop 58 Verification

- Commit: `1840f0663` (canonical DNS duration and exact RDP lifecycle fix).
- Routine gate: 8,379 passed, 5 skipped; Ruff check and format check passed.
- Generated bundle: 122,916 records across 22 evaluated sources.
- Deterministic evaluation: 96.2817, acceptance PASS; pillars 100.00 parseability,
  96.82 plausibility, 93.95 causality, and 92.95 timing.
- Rendered DNS probe: all 3,255 matched response-bearing UDP DNS transactions close
  0.075-9.462 ms after response, with no negative or over-12.001 ms tail. Loop 57 had
  42 tails over 100 ms and a 4.902802-second maximum.
- Rendered RDP probe: all 15 visible Type 10 `userinit.exe` processes terminate
  1.150-3.408 seconds after creation. Loop 57's 18 matched processes all exceeded
  5.5 seconds and had a 2,514.518-second median lifetime.
- Blind panel: initial scores 44/70/91/82 (mean 71.75); verdict disagreement and a
  47-point spread triggered deliberation. Final scores 80/87/91/89 (mean 86.75),
  unanimously Synthetic.
- Next highest-impact families: explicit-proxy request/child phase causality and one
  canonical Windows process/session token identity across Security, Sysmon, and eCAR.

## Loop 59 Family Contract

### Explicit-proxy packet-phase causality

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-58 `hard_contradiction` in the explicit-proxy
  transaction family.
- **Owning abstraction:** `ProxyPhasePlanner` owns canonical CONNECT/origin phases, while
  `NetworkObservationPlanner` owns projection of those packet phases through each sensor clock.
- **Invariant:** for one transaction-bound tunnel at every common sensor, the observed CONNECT
  request precedes the proxy-origin TCP open and outbound TLS detection. HTTP `ts` represents the
  request packet time, not a later analyzer-queue delay. All child transports in one explicit-proxy
  action share the sensor-local route delay so canonical parent-before-child gaps survive projection.
- **Entry paths:** explicit CONNECT requests, inspected HTTPS tunnel setup, gateway attempts, and
  direct HTTP proxy requests; reused preexisting tunnels keep their explicit manager-owned path.
- **Consumers:** Zeek conn/http/ssl, proxy access, canonical tunnel state, deterministic timing
  evaluation, and exact-byte/SNI blind correlation.
- **Layer rationale:** the canonical planner already orders request and child phases; independent
  transport route delay and HTTP timestamp sampling invert them only at the source-observation
  owner. Emitter clamping would leave sibling sensors inconsistent.
- **Sibling risks:** ordinary unrelated transports retain independent route texture; only members
  sharing an explicit-proxy parent action share the offset. HTTP rows without a canonical request
  anchor retain their compatibility timing.

### Canonical Windows process/session token identity

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-58 `hard_contradiction` and `contract_gap` across the
  process and RDP families.
- **Owning abstraction:** canonical Windows token profiling owns integrity, elevation type, and
  mandatory label; deferred session composition owns the LogonGuid before endpoint publication.
- **Invariant:** one Windows process renders the same integrity truth in Security 4688 and Sysmon
  Event 1, with mandatory-label and elevation fields derived from that token. Every RDP
  `userinit.exe` and `explorer.exe` receives the same nonzero session LogonGuid as its Type 10 4624
  before any source is dispatched.
- **Entry paths:** ordinary process generation, exact initial RDP session composition, system and
  user processes, and deferred publication/recovery.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security 4688, Sysmon Event 1, eCAR PROCESS CREATE, state identities, and
  cross-source process/session joins.
- **Layer rationale:** token and session identity are shared canonical truth. Deriving defaults in
  individual emitters caused Medium/High disagreement and zero-to-nonzero GUID transitions.
- **Sibling risks:** SYSTEM and built-in service tokens retain Default/System semantics; a High user
  token uses Full elevation unless a future canonical alternate-token model explicitly says
  otherwise. Non-RDP compatibility events may still use zero GUID when no session owns one.

## Loop 59 Verification

- Commit: `7b947962f` (explicit-proxy observation causality and canonical Windows
  token/session identity).
- Routine gate: 8,380 passed, 5 skipped; Ruff check and format check passed.
- Generated bundle: 122,916 records across 22 evaluated sources.
- Deterministic evaluation: 96.2817, acceptance PASS; pillars 100.00 parseability,
  96.82 plausibility, 93.95 causality, and 92.95 timing.
- Rendered proxy probe: all 522 exact-byte/SNI-matched successful tunnels on the DMZ
  sensor place CONNECT before origin TCP and TLS; minimum gaps are 8.074 ms and
  31.597 ms. Loop 58 had 392 origin and 115 TLS inversions in the same 522-tunnel set.
- Rendered Windows probe: all 969 exact Security 4688/Sysmon Event 1 joins agree on
  integrity, no High user token has a non-Full elevation type, and all 30 matched Type
  10 `userinit.exe`/`explorer.exe` rows share the nonzero session LogonGuid.
- Blind panel: initial scores 44/72/72/72 (mean 65.00); verdict disagreement triggered
  deliberation. Final scores 70/78/82/80 (mean 77.50), unanimously Synthetic.
- Next highest-impact families: packet-derived Zeek DNS query/response identity, unified
  SSH session/history/process timing, and KDC-local AS/TGS/logon ordering.

## Loop 60 Family Contract

### Packet-derived single-exchange UDP DNS identity

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-59 `hard_contradiction` in the canonical DNS
  transaction and source-observation family.
- **Owning abstraction:** `NetworkTransactionPlanner` owns canonical DNS request/response packet
  timing; `NetworkObservationPlanner` freezes the same packet anchors for each Zeek sensor.
- **Invariant:** for a response-bearing UDP DNS transaction rendered with history `Dd` and exactly
  one origin and one response packet, `dns.ts == conn.ts` and
  `dns.ts + dns.rtt == conn.ts + conn.duration` at every sensor. Query and response are the two
  packets that define the transport interval; neither source projection nor the emitter may add
  an independent analyzer delay or close slack. TCP DNS, retransmitted/multipacket UDP DNS, and
  unanswered queries retain their protocol-specific phase models.
- **Entry paths:** authored `DnsContext` connections, synthesized resolver transactions, baseline
  DNS, explicit-proxy destination lookups, causal DNS prerequisites, and direct emitter fixtures.
- **Consumers:** Zeek conn/dns rows, canonical network state, source-window admission, deterministic
  evaluation, proxy DNS dependencies, and packet-level forensic probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the contradiction is shared request/response packet truth. Repairing only
  `dns.log` would leave canonical duration and `conn.log` inconsistent; retaining emitter-local
  jitter would recreate the defect after sensor projection.
- **Sibling risks:** DNS retries, truncation/TCP fallback, response loss, and true multipacket
  exchanges must not be collapsed into the single-exchange contract.

### Sub-millisecond Windows WFP transport admission

- **Classification:** `family_level`; generation-discovered `sibling_defect` in endpoint
  source timing exposed by the exact DNS packet interval.
- **Owning abstraction:** `SourceTimingPlanner` owns admission of Windows WFP observations into
  their source-local canonical transport interval.
- **Invariant:** a WFP 5156 observation is at or after the source-local transport open and strictly
  before transport close. The planner reserves only source timestamp precision at the close edge;
  it must not require the generic 1 ms lifecycle ordering gap when the complete transport is shorter
  than 1 ms.
- **Entry paths:** source- and destination-side Windows WFP projections for UDP and TCP connections,
  including packet-derived DNS exchanges and remote-authentication transports.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security 5156, endpoint admission state, remote-auth transport anchors,
  authentication timing, and rendered cross-source transport probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the impossible interval is created by generic source timing before rendering;
  changing Windows emitter timestamps would bypass frozen timing and admission state.
- **Sibling risks:** process-create/dependent ordering keeps its 1 ms lifecycle gap. WFP process
  attribution is retained only when its already-modeled process lifecycle is valid; this fix does
  not fabricate or move process identity.

## Loop 60 Verification

- Commits: `b5b9617f0` (packet-derived DNS timing) and `1cb4fbfcb` (sub-millisecond
  WFP source-admission sibling fix).
- Routine gate: 8,381 passed, 5 skipped; Ruff check and format check passed across
  769 files.
- Generated bundle: 122,916 records across 22 evaluated sources.
- Deterministic evaluation: 96.2817, acceptance PASS; pillars 100.00 parseability,
  96.82 plausibility, 93.95 causality, and 92.95 timing.
- Rendered DNS probe: all 3,863 qualifying one-query/one-response UDP transactions
  across core, DB, and DMZ sensors have exact query-start and response-close equality
  between `dns.json` and `conn.json`, with zero mismatches.
- Generation-discovered WFP sibling: a valid 463 microsecond DNS transport initially
  failed because WFP admission reserved a generic 1 ms close margin. A WFP-specific
  1 microsecond precision boundary now admits the interval; the exact regression and
  complete regeneration pass.
- Blind panel: initial scores 56/86/34/68 (mean 61.00); verdict disagreement and a
  52-point spread triggered deliberation. Final scores 68/88/53/77 (mean 71.50), with
  three Synthetic verdicts and one Inconclusive, synthetic-leaning verdict.
- Next highest-impact families: host-specific Windows execution metadata, browser
  process action lifecycles, and source-coherent SSH observation.

## Loop 61 Family Contract

### Host/provider Windows execution metadata

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-60 `distribution_texture` fingerprint in Windows
  Security source-native metadata.
- **Owning abstraction:** `WindowsEventEmitter` owns the Security provider's `System/Execution`
  projection; its deterministic provider-thread lifecycle derives from canonical host, provider
  process, source time, and occurrence identity.
- **Invariant:** execution ThreadIDs are four-byte aligned, stable for one deterministic
  host/provider thread lifetime, reused across related event families through that provider, and
  independently populated per host. Successful and failed authentication must not use visibly
  disjoint hard-coded pools, and high-volume WFP events must not exhaust the same finite range on
  every system.
- **Entry paths:** all canonical Windows Security renderers, including WFP 5156, authentication,
  Kerberos, process auditing, SMB auditing, account management, workstation transitions, service
  and task management, and compatibility rows that already carry explicit execution metadata.
- **Consumers:** Windows XML and Snare projections, parser validation, exact source publication,
  source-finalization replay, and metadata-distribution probes.
- **Layer rationale:** Execution PID/TID is source-local provider metadata rather than canonical
  activity truth. Central normalization in the Windows emitter keeps every event family and output
  projection consistent without polluting shared events.
- **Sibling risks:** direct compatibility fixtures without a canonical occurrence retain their
  explicit values. Thread identity must remain order-, worker-, retry-, and checkpoint-independent;
  it must not introduce mutable renderer state or change event timestamps.

### Installation-specific NT device-volume identity

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-60 sibling `distribution_texture` in the same Windows
  source-native host identity family.
- **Owning abstraction:** Windows Security path projection owns drive-letter to NT device-volume
  rendering, keyed by the concrete host installation and drive.
- **Invariant:** one host/drive maps consistently to one `HarddiskVolumeN`, different drives on one
  host do not alias, and a heterogeneous fleet does not collapse every C: path to Volume1. Existing
  NT device paths and the kernel `System` image pass through unchanged.
- **Entry paths:** outbound and inbound WFP 5156 application paths and direct path-conversion
  compatibility calls.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security 5156, WFP policy bucketing, endpoint-flow joins, and source-native
  field probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the mapping is installation-local rendering truth; canonical process images
  correctly remain drive-letter paths shared with Sysmon and eCAR.
- **Sibling risks:** this loop does not claim to model dynamic volume remounting. The stable mapping
  is scoped to the six-hour host installation and preserves path identity within that scope.

## Loop 61 Verification

  96.82 plausibility, 93.95 causality, and 92.95 timing.
- Rendered Windows probe: all 18,232 Security rows have aligned execution ThreadIDs;
  per-host WFP populations contain 307–799 unique IDs with zero identical host-pair sets.
  Ten Windows hosts use seven stable installation-specific NT volume identities instead of
  universal `HarddiskVolume1`.
- Blind panel: scores 84/66/68/83 (mean 75.25), unanimously Synthetic. Deliberation was not
  triggered: average verdict confidence was 87.25 and score spread was 18.
- The repaired execution-thread and NT-volume fingerprints were absent from every report.
- Next highest-impact families: source-native identifier entropy across proxy/eCAR/Postfix,
  Sysmon Event 8 target-thread semantics, and command-derived process/scan execution.

## Loop 62 Family Contract

### Source-native deterministic identifier entropy

- **Classification:** `new_family`; loop-61 `hard_contradiction` / probable generator-identity
  leak spanning otherwise unrelated visible source families.
- **Owning abstraction:** a seed-scoped deterministic digest utility owns full-width entropy;
  the proxy renderer, storage-world compiler, and Postfix activity owner independently choose
  their source-native prefix, width, alphabet, and semantic identity inputs.
- **Invariant:** a requested N-hex-character identifier contains N digest-derived characters,
  rather than formatting a 32-bit seed into a wider zero-padded slot. Values remain stable for
  the same generation seed and semantic identity, change with that identity or public seed, and
  use separate namespaces across products. Proxy tunnel children retain one tunnel identifier,
  one storage file retains one canonical identity across its consumers, and all Postfix lifecycle
  lines and SMTP replies retain the same per-hop queue ID.
- **Entry paths:** explicit-proxy HTTPS child rendering and tunnel summarization; default compiled
  SMB/storage files projected into eCAR and server evidence; Postfix receive, delivery, removal,
  SMTP reply, and Received-header paths.
- **Consumers:** proxy grouping/checkpoint replay, eCAR file object correlation, storage/share
  registries, SMB/File projections, Postfix queue state, SMTP evidence, parsers, and blind
  distribution probes.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical identity ownership and source-native syntax are distinct. The
  shared utility provides deterministic entropy only; each owning product layer selects its own
  visible shape and correlation scope instead of exposing one global identifier convention.
- **Sibling risks:** internal action/cohort IDs, Zeek UIDs/FUIDs, UUID-shaped lifecycle identities,
  and intentionally 32-bit protocol fields are not widened merely because they use deterministic
  seeds. The material output change requires a behavior-manifest revision and exact retry,
  checkpoint, storage, mail, and proxy regression coverage.

- Next highest-impact families: SSH continuation/session identity, canonical public IPv6 identity,

## Loop 63 Family Contract

### Observation-orphaned systemd-logind close identity

- **Classification:** `exact_regression`; loop-62 `hard_contradiction` against the existing
  canonical SSH/logind session-identity contract.
- **Owning abstraction:** canonical session allocation owns the logind session ID; the syslog
  renderer may order and format rows but must not replace that shared identity during terminal
  normalization.
- **Invariant:** every visible `New session N` or `Removed session N` row preserves the canonical
  `AuthContext.session_id` used by eCAR `USER_SESSION` and process lifecycle rows. If observation
  drops a matching opener, the orphaned closer keeps `N`; final rendering must not guess that it
  represents a pre-window session and synthesize a different ID. Repair of duplicate or
  backward-moving visible `New session` rows remains scoped to genuinely noncanonical compatibility
  input and carries a rewritten ID only to an explicitly matched visible closer.
- **Entry paths:** deferred and compatibility SSH action bundles, baseline remote administration,
  storyline SSH, SCP receiver sessions, local Linux logons, pre-window sessions, and direct syslog
  compatibility fixtures.
- **Consumers:** systemd-logind syslog, eCAR `USER_SESSION` and process rows, SSH/PAM lifecycle
  joins, blind-review correlation, terminal host normalization, checkpoint replay, and SOF-ELK®
  rendering.
- **Layer rationale:** the continuation and canonical event already agree on the ID. The defect is
  introduced only by terminal syslog rewriting after observation, so the smallest owning-layer fix
  is to preserve unmatched close IDs rather than mutate canonical planning or patch SSH messages.
- **Sibling risks:** matched rewritten compatibility sessions must still keep New/Removed parity;
  malformed oversized IDs remain nonfatal; genuine pre-window closes remain valid orphan rows and
  are not fabricated into visible opens.

- Rendered SSH probe: five visible eCAR termination/logind removal lifecycle joins retain one
  canonical session ID, with zero mismatches. The four exact loop-62 mismatches are repaired.
- Blind initial panel: 29/71/66/92 (mean 64.50), with one Real and three Synthetic verdicts.
  Deliberation was triggered by verdict disagreement and a 63-point spread; final scores were

- The repaired cross-source SSH ID substitution was absent from every report. The highest-impact
  next families are canonical binary content identity, Event 4648 host ownership, and Zeek
  analyzer declarations.

## Loop 64 Family Contract

### Canonical process-binary hashes and PE metadata

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-63 repeated `hard_contradiction` spanning installed
  third-party releases and build-owned Windows system binaries.
- **Owning abstraction:** `ProcessContext.binary_identity`, populated by the deployment/local
  artifact registries at dispatch preparation, owns executable content digests and optional PE
  version resources. The Sysmon renderer owns only source-native projection of that exact identity.
- **Invariant:** one `BinaryReleaseIdentity` or `LocalArtifactBinaryIdentity` renders one complete
  hash set at every installation path, user, and host. Distinct release/build/architecture/artifact
  keys render distinct digest sets. PE metadata and hashes come from the same binary identity;
  unresolved and virtual-kernel identities never acquire fabricated file hashes or VERSIONINFO.
- **Entry paths:** baseline, storyline, remote administration, scheduled tasks, services, browser
  and application activity, retained local executable publication, image loads, and compatibility
  events that omit an attached production identity.
- **Consumers:** Sysmon Event 1 and Event 7, Security/eCAR process joins, deployment audits,
  checkpoint/retry replay, blind cross-host release probes, and future source-native hash renderers.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical release and local-artifact identities already exclude placement and
  include content-owning build dimensions. The defect is introduced when Sysmon ignores the attached
  identity and hashes a path-derived fallback, so the fix is to render existing canonical truth
  rather than create a second emitter-local identity model.
- **Sibling risks:** direct unit/legacy callers without dispatch preparation retain deterministic
  compatibility projection. Genuine local artifacts remain content-specific. Signed module fallback
  metadata must not override an attached exact module identity, and hashes must remain uppercase in
  Sysmon's source-native `Hashes` field.

### Host-local Linux transient process identity

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-64 `hard_contradiction` and `distribution_texture`
  findings in Linux process identity across syslog and eCAR.
- **Owning abstraction:** `StateManager` owns one time-aware PID namespace and hidden workload
  progression per Linux host. Lifecycle generators must request process identity from that owner;
  source renderers may only project the allocated PID.
- **Invariant:** a newly started one-shot process consumes a PID from the same host/time namespace
  as every other canonical or syslog-only transient process. Its follow-on messages and termination
  retain that PID. Hidden churn has stable host-specific workload magnitude as well as minute/hour
  variation, so unrelated hosts do not converge on one fleet-wide PID/time slope.
- **Entry paths:** anacron lifecycle, scheduled CRON shell/workload processes, SSH and sudo
  transients, ordinary Linux system/user processes, deferred baseline generation, and direct
  transient syslog allocation.
- **Consumers:** eCAR process create/terminate records, RFC 5424 syslog APP-NAME/PROCID fields,
  process parent/lifecycle state, checkpoint/retry replay, blind chronology probes, and PID-wrap
  validation.
- **Layer rationale:** the low anacron PID was introduced by bypassing process materialization and
  selecting a private random number in baseline code. Routing it through `StateManager` repairs the
  shared truth; host workload texture belongs in the allocator rather than any source renderer.
- **Sibling risks:** durable boot daemons retain their fixed boot PIDs, explicit PID namespaces
  remain valid, out-of-order 30-second allocation lanes retain capacity, PID wrap/reuse rules stay
  unchanged, and anacron source rows remain one coherent daily lifecycle.

## Loop 66 Family Contract

### RDP session publication before dependent user activity

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-65 `hard_contradiction` spanning Windows Security,
  Sysmon, and eCAR session/process evidence.
- **Owning abstraction:** the RDP action bundle owns the session authentication frontier through
  `SessionMaterializationPlan.source_ready_time`; the storyline scheduler owns applying that
  frontier before dispatching dependent authored activity.
- **Invariant:** a remote-interactive transport and successful Type 10 login are observable before
  any non-bootstrap process or command uses the resulting logon ID. Source-native delay may not
  invert that relationship in Security, Sysmon, or eCAR. The bundle's `winlogon.exe` bootstrap may
  precede authentication, while `userinit.exe`, `explorer.exe`, and authored user activity retain
  their lifecycle order after the authentication frontier.
- **Entry paths:** typed `rdp_session`, legacy/compatibility `logon_type: 10`, baseline remote
  administration, successful remote-interactive authentication, reconnect/session reuse, and
  deferred RDP publication/recovery.
- **Consumers:** Security 4624/4688, Sysmon Event 1, eCAR USER_SESSION/PROCESS/FLOW, session state,
  source-timing planners, follow-on storyline placement, checkpoint/retry replay, and blind
  cross-source chronology probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the exact RDP bundle already owns and persists the authentication-ready
  frontier. The contradiction is introduced when one storyline entry path ignores that canonical
  truth, so the repair belongs in storyline scheduling rather than emitter timestamp rewriting.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve source-side `mstsc.exe` and TCP/3389 transport-before-auth ordering,
  successful-flow semantics, bootstrap process order, explicit logoff/session close, reconnect
  behavior, source publication deadlines, and exact deferred continuation recovery.

## Loop 67 Family Contract

### Host-build-owned Windows PE identity coverage

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loops 64–66 repeated `hard_contradiction` and
  `schema_or_format` findings across Windows inbox binaries.
- **Owning abstraction:** the deployment content registry owns one `BinaryReleaseIdentity` per
  exact Windows build, architecture, and artifact. The system/application catalogs own the
  executable's VERSIONINFO vocabulary; Sysmon only renders the attached canonical identity.
- **Invariant:** an OS-owned executable on one host uses that host's resolved Windows build in its
  release key and FileVersion, and its hashes derive from that exact release. The same executable
  on different builds has different content digests, while adjacent inbox components on one host
  remain in one build family. Known OS binaries do not lose all PE fields merely because one
  generation entry path used a system-process descriptor instead of an application descriptor.
- **Entry paths:** interactive/RDP bootstrap, baseline system services and scheduled tasks,
  storyline commands, remote administration, application-catalog Windows Explorer/RDP tools,
  loaded modules, and direct compatibility rendering.
- **Consumers:** Sysmon Event 1/Event 7, Security/eCAR process joins, deployment audits,
  application assignment, checkpoint/retry replay, and blind cross-host build/hash probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the contradiction originates in split catalog ownership: Explorer is
  compiled as one fixed application release while many native descriptors omit VERSIONINFO and
  fall back to emitter-local tables. Consolidating source data into the deployment catalogs and
  binding host build there repairs canonical truth rather than rewriting rendered rows.
- **Sibling risks:** third-party/versioned releases must remain version-owned rather than inherit
  the Windows build; unresolved or artifact-local binaries may legitimately lack PE resources;
  compatibility callers retain deterministic data-driven metadata; paths and OriginalFileName
  casing remain source-native; deployment overrides and architecture separation stay intact.

  source-native SSH/IDS timestamp construction. Nmap command semantics remains queued from loops

## Loop 68 Family Contract

### KDC processing after exact packet-admission evidence

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-67 `hard_contradiction` across Windows Security 5156
  and Kerberos 4768/4769/4771 on both domain controllers.
- **Owning abstraction:** the canonical network-connection bundle owns the KDC transport tuple and
  transaction identity; `SourceTimingPlanner` owns the source-local WFP-admission frontier and the
  dependent KDC audit timestamp.
- **Invariant:** when a visible successful client-to-DC port-88 transaction produces both target
  WFP and KDC audit evidence, the exact target-side Event 5156 renders before every 4768, 4769, or
  4771 bound to that transport. Both rows remain inside the canonical transport lifetime after the
  DC clock and source latency are applied.
- **Entry paths:** baseline Kerberos connections, connection-triggered TGT/TGS repair, explicit
  fresh-account exchanges, failed pre-authentication with wire evidence, machine-account traffic,
  and higher-level authentication bundles that delegate to the network contract.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security rendering, KDC/WFP tuple joins, machine-logon ticket ordering,
  source-timing checkpoint/retry state, deterministic causality probes, and blind detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical connection materialization already owns the exact tuple and WFP
  dependent event. The inversion occurs because connection-triggered KDC audits publish before the
  target WFP frontier is admitted and carry no exact transport dependency. Bind that canonical
  transport to the KDC occurrence and constrain it in shared source timing; do not rewrite emitter
  timestamps.
- **Sibling risks:** cached-TGT flows may legitimately omit 4768; standalone KDC audit events
  without modeled transport retain their existing timing; denied/unanswered connections must not
  acquire successful WFP/KDC evidence; short transports must fail safely rather than render audit
  rows after close; source-side WFP and remote-auth ordering remain unchanged.

## Loop 68 Result

- **Fix:** successful KDC audit intent now travels through the canonical port-88 connection
  request. Target-side 5156 publication precedes transport-bound 4768/4769/4771 source timing,
  including outbound/inbound baseline profiles, DC cycles, logon tickets, machine-account traffic,
  and visible failed pre-authentication.

## Loop 69 Family Contract

### Immutable controlling terminal for a continuing Linux session shell

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-68 `hard_contradiction` across eCAR process identity and
  sudo syslog on 11 Linux hosts.
- **Owning abstraction:** the Linux sudo session route owns the exact logon/session-to-TTY binding;
  the per-session shell and all sudo children consume that binding.
- **Invariant:** one live Linux interactive or SSH session and its continuing shell process may
  publish at most one controlling terminal. A later sudo request routed to that same session must
  reuse its existing `pts/*`; a different terminal requires a separately owned session and shell.
- **Entry paths:** baseline extra-syslog sudo activity, typed sudo action bundles, pre-window
  carried-in sessions, SSH-owned sessions, and direct generator compatibility calls.
- **Consumers:** syslog sudo command rendering, PAM open/close rows, eCAR parent/child process
  identity, foreground serialization, strict lifecycle retention, checkpoint state, and blind host
  correlation.
- **Layer rationale:** syslog already renders the effective TTY returned by the generator. The
  contradiction is created earlier when different requested TTYs are allowed to bind to one reused
  session shell, so enforcement belongs in the session-route owner rather than the emitter.
- **Sibling risks:** concurrent sessions for one user must retain distinct terminals; closed
  sessions must release their routes; a malformed multi-TTY reverse route must fail closed;
  foreground timing and strict lifecycle rollback remain unchanged.

## Loop 70 Family Contract

### Source-native SMB tree-connect packet timing

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-69 `distribution_texture` across every rendered core
  Zeek SMB mapping.
- **Owning abstraction:** the SMB action bundle and its timing planner own authentication and tree
  connection phase timestamps before source-native rendering.
- **Invariant:** an SMB tree mapping must occur after its parent transport is established and before
  later file operations/transport close, but its packet-stage timestamp must not be restricted to an
  integer-millisecond delta that preserves the TCP connection start's microsecond residue.
- **Entry paths:** baseline SMB client/server activity, legitimate lateral movement, typed SMB file
  activity, Windows remote administration, domain-policy/SYSVOL access, and direct bundle tests.
- **Consumers:** canonical `smb_tree_connect` events, Zeek `smb_mapping`, Windows share audit,
  Linux Samba syslog, file-operation timing, source observation, and deterministic replay.
- **Layer rationale:** the exact lattice is introduced when the bundle adds integer-millisecond auth
  and tree delays to the canonical transport start. Emitters faithfully preserve that time, so the
  repair belongs in bundle timing rather than Zeek formatting.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve deterministic output across workers and hash seeds; keep auth before
  tree-connect, tree-connect before file operations, every SMB child inside transport bounds, and
  source-local multi-sensor timing relationships valid.

- **Next family:** preserve canonical HTTP authority and Referer semantics across explicit-proxy
  client and origin legs; six Host mutations and one isolated cross-source Referer mismatch remain.

## Loop 71 Family Contract

### Canonical HTTP authority and headers across explicit-proxy legs

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-70 `hard_contradiction` across explicit-proxy client,
  proxy-access, and origin-facing Zeek HTTP evidence.
- **Owning abstraction:** the explicit-proxy transaction bundle owns the logical HTTP request and
  its canonical origin authority, Referer, and user-agent before either transport leg is rendered.
- **Invariant:** one logical proxied HTTP request preserves the same canonical authority and
  request-header semantics across the client-to-proxy and proxy-to-origin legs unless an explicit
  modeled transformation owns the change. The origin-facing Host must identify the selected origin,
  and a present Referer must not disappear on one sibling source.
- **Entry paths:** cleartext absolute-form proxy requests, HTTPS CONNECT transactions, browser and
  command-line clients, uploads, package-manager traffic, cache hits, denies, gateway failures, and
  direct transaction-bundle calls.
- **Consumers:** proxy access rendering, Zeek HTTP on both legs, origin DNS and TLS identity, web
  access logs, route selection, connection correlation, source observation, and blind network
  review.
- **Layer rationale:** emitters consume transaction fields independently, but the contradiction is
  created when the bundle derives or forwards different authority/header values for sibling legs.
  Repair the shared transaction truth rather than normalizing one rendered source afterward.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve absolute-form client URIs versus origin-form outbound URIs, CONNECT
  authority ports, intentional privacy/header stripping when explicitly modeled, cache/deny paths
  with no origin leg, deterministic retries, and valid DNS/TLS routing when the public service uses
  aliases or CDN addresses.

## Loop 72 Family Contract

### CONNECT tunnel lifetime bounded by its carrying TCP session

- **Classification:** `family_level`; loop-71 `hard_contradiction` across explicit-proxy access
  records and the exact client-to-proxy Zeek transport.
- **Owning abstraction:** the explicit-proxy transaction bundle and channel manager own the CONNECT
  tunnel as an application lifecycle nested inside one canonical client transport; the network
  connection bundle owns that outer transport's final interval.
- **Invariant:** for every completed explicit-proxy CONNECT transaction, tunnel setup and advertised
  tunnel duration fit entirely inside the exact carrying client-to-proxy TCP interval. Proxy close,
  channel retirement, byte ledgers, and source-native duration fields consume the same final close
  bound rather than independently sampled intervals.
- **Entry paths:** one-shot CONNECT, successful HTTPS inspection, persistent tunnel reuse, failed or
  denied CONNECT attempts, right-censored end-of-window sessions, recovery/retry publication, and
  direct transaction-bundle calls.
- **Consumers:** proxy access `tunnel_duration_ms`, Zeek client transport duration/state, eCAR client
  FLOW, firewall visibility, channel reuse/retirement, byte accounting, checkpoint recovery, and
  blind network joins keyed by client source port and tunnel identity.
- **Layer rationale:** the proxy field and Zeek row are faithful renderings of separately retained
  lifecycle values. Their contradiction must be removed where the nested tunnel and outer transport
  close are planned and committed, not by clamping an emitter field after canonical publication.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve successful tunnel payload accounting and exact source-port identity;
  do not turn denied/auth-required CONNECT control messages into tunnels; retain valid reuse and
  right-censor semantics; keep process ownership through the outer close; maintain deterministic
  recovery and source-specific observation timing.

- **Initial panel:** Threat Hunter 66 (Synthetic, 70 verdict confidence), Detection Engineer 76
  (Synthetic, 88), Network Forensics 34 (Real, 78), Host/EDR 32 (Real, 72); mean 52.0.
- **Deliberation:** triggered by verdict disagreement and a 44-point spread. Revised scores were
  72, 78, 52, and 42; mean 61.0 with two Synthetic, one Inconclusive, and one Real verdict.
- **Target-family disposition:** the Loop 71 CONNECT/TCP lifetime contradiction did not recur in
  the rendered probe or any initial expert report.
- **Next family:** order fresh Kerberos AS/TGS acquisition and port-88 transport before the
  successful logon and service traffic that consume those credentials.

## Loop 73 Family Contract

### Fresh Kerberos acquisition before dependent logon and service use

- **Classification:** `family_level`; Loop 72 `hard_contradiction` across Windows Security 4624,
  4768/4769, Zeek port-88 transport, and dependent LDAP/service traffic on both domain controllers.
- **Owning abstraction:** authentication action bundles and the canonical KDC exchange planner own
  credential acquisition as a prerequisite of the exact logon/service activity; source timing owns
  only source-native observation offsets inside that dependency graph.
- **Invariant:** when a modeled successful Kerberos logon or service connection consumes a newly
  acquired ticket, its client-to-KDC transport, 4768 AS result, and required 4769 service-ticket
  result render before the dependent 4624 and service transport. A cached-ticket path must not bind
  a later fresh exchange to the already completed use.
- **Entry paths:** machine-account network logons, user network logons, domain authentication
  bundles, LDAP and SMB access, scheduled/service activity, causal ticket repair, failed pre-auth
  recovery, and direct compatibility calls.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security KDC and logon records, Zeek port-88 and dependent service flows,
  WFP admission, eCAR sessions, state-managed ticket cache, source timing, evaluator joins, and blind
  detection/network pivots.
- **Layer rationale:** the inversion recurs across both DCs because KDC and dependent activity are
  scheduled as nearby siblings rather than one credential-consumption graph. Emitters faithfully
  render those separate times, so the repair belongs in bundle/planner dependency ownership rather
  than timestamp rewriting in Windows or Zeek output.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve legitimate cached-ticket logons without redundant 4768; retain AS
  before TGS and KDC WFP-before-audit guarantees; do not convert NTLM or local logons to Kerberos;
  keep failed exchanges non-successful; respect transport/process/session bounds, DC clock offsets,
  checkpoint recovery, and deterministic replay.

## Loop 73 Result

- **Implementation commit:** `8dc3eaa28` (`fix: order fresh Kerberos before service use`).
- **Behavior contract:** revision 37,
  `c6916d584af620a5a0081c7701b8443765d2b8a6fddacd33b0ba9238c2d2a66f`.
- **Verification:** 8,405 routine tests passed, 5 skipped, and 2,009 deselected; focused Kerberos
  and behavior-manifest tests passed; Ruff check and format check passed; all 92 configuration
  files validated; the scenario retained only its existing 24 informational pivot notes.
- **Rendered invariant:** 210 fresh Kerberos AS/TGS bundles joined to exact KDC and dependent
  service transports, with zero ordering violations and a minimum 1.254-second KDC-to-service
  observation margin.
- **Automated evaluation:** 96.47762068969884 PASS across 127,848 records (parseability

  (Synthetic, 76), Network Forensics 64 (Synthetic, 81), Host/EDR 67 (Synthetic, 84); mean 66.25.
- **Deliberation:** not triggered; verdicts were unanimous, average verdict confidence was 80.75,
  and the synthetic-confidence spread was 6.
- **Target-family disposition:** the Loop 72 Kerberos acquisition inversion did not recur in the
  rendered probe or any initial expert report.
- **Next family:** make Zeek file-analysis provenance agree with every rendered digest across SMB,
  HTTP, SMTP, certificate, and sibling file-observation paths.

## Loop 74 Family Contract

### Authoritative Zeek file-analysis provenance for rendered digests

- **Classification:** `family_level`; Loop 73 `schema_or_format` and `contract_gap` finding across
  97 SMB-derived Zeek `files.log` rows.
- **Owning abstraction:** canonical `FileTransferContext` owns the analysis results and their
  provenance before source observation or Zeek rendering; SMB action bundles adapt durable content
  identities into that contract.
- **Invariant:** a non-empty MD5, SHA1, or SHA256 result may exist only when the same canonical file
  observation declares the corresponding `MD5`, `SHA1`, or `SHA256` analyzer. Source observation
  may coherently hide all analyzer results, but no renderer may expose an orphan digest.
- **Entry paths:** persistent and compatibility SMB reads/writes, HTTP request and response bodies,
  multipart leaves, SMTP/MIME attachments, TLS certificate files, staged archive transfer, direct
  canonical context construction, and source-local analyzer visibility projection.
- **Consumers:** Zeek `files.log`, HTTP/SMTP/TLS FUID references, PE analysis, network observation
  plans, evaluator field-agreement checks, checkpoint serialization, and blind detection review.
- **Layer rationale:** analyzer names and digest values are sibling facts on the canonical file
  transfer, so their consistency belongs in `FileTransferContext`. SMB callers currently provide
  durable digests while declaring only MIME; they must adapt into the shared contract. Fixing only
  the Zeek emitter would conceal malformed canonical truth from sibling consumers.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve legitimate MIME-only and analyzer-free rows; compare analyzer names
  case-insensitively without rewriting source-native spelling; keep observation-driven analyzer
  loss atomic with digest loss; do not imply that a digest was computed when its field is empty;
  retain stable content identity, FUID, and multi-sensor correlation.

## Loop 74 Result

- **Implementation commit:** `8fca52b68` (`fix: align Zeek file digests with analyzers`).
- **Behavior contract:** revision 38,
  `830a3f817076b6db4edeb1b1234236b8d94a977494041326ea42adcf91598aed`.
- **Verification:** 8,409 routine tests passed, 5 skipped, and 2,009 deselected; focused Zeek,
  SMB/storage, observation, and behavior-manifest tests passed; Ruff check and format check passed;
  all 92 configuration files validated; the scenario retained only its existing 24 informational
  pivot notes.
- **Rendered invariant:** all 1,244 digest-bearing rows among 2,097 Zeek file observations declared
  every corresponding analyzer, with zero provenance violations across SSL, SMB, HTTP, and SMTP.
- **Automated evaluation:** 96.47762068969884 PASS across 127,848 records (parseability

- **Deliberation:** triggered by verdict disagreement and a 37-point spread. Revised scores were
  69, 80, 82, and 74; mean 76.25 with unanimous Synthetic verdicts.
- **Target-family disposition:** the Loop 73 digest/analyzer provenance defect did not recur in the
  rendered probe or any expert report.
- **Next family:** reconcile explicit-proxy tunnel counters and their exact client-to-proxy Zeek
  transport through one authoritative byte ledger.

## Loop 75 Family Contract

### Authoritative explicit-proxy client-transport byte ledger

- **Classification:** `family_level`; Loop 74 `hard_contradiction` across 430 of 719 joined
  inspected CONNECT tunnels, including 118 gross zero-loss or high-margin mismatches.
- **Owning abstraction:** the explicit-proxy transaction bundle and channel manager own one
  client-to-proxy transport budget and the completed child-request ledger; the network connection
  bundle owns the canonical TCP payload totals carried by that ledger.
- **Invariant:** for every completed inspected tunnel, CONNECT control bytes plus all completed
  tunneled request bytes equal the canonical client transport's directional payload totals. A
  deliberately unobserved proxy request must remain represented in canonical tunnel accounting;
  observation may not silently create a second byte truth.
- **Entry paths:** initial inspected HTTPS request, persistent child reuse, request-local fallback,
  capacity replacement, timeout/close, source-observation projection, right-censored sessions,
  checkpoint recovery, and direct transaction-bundle calls.
- **Consumers:** proxy access CONNECT and child rows, Zeek client `conn.log`, eCAR FLOW, firewall
  accounting, channel budgets and receipts, timeout retirement, evaluator joins, and blind
  same-tuple byte probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the proxy emitter currently totals observed child rows while the physical
  transport retains an independently forecast browser-group payload. The contract must reconcile
  actual committed operations with the parent budget at the bundle/channel boundary rather than
  inventing compensating bytes in either renderer.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve CONNECT control-message scope; do not double-count upload bodies or
  TLS framing; keep proxy-origin egress accounting independent; retain valid request-local fallbacks,
  process lifetime, UID/source-port identity, observation semantics, deterministic recovery, and
  exact channel capacity enforcement.

## Loop 75 Result

- **Implementation commit:** `1e2874272` (`fix: reconcile proxy transport byte accounting`).
- **Behavior contract:** revision 39,
  `ccf193ccfc507846ebf4044d8b0af7a6e3b8116add68bb3a4549f20303987776`.
- **Verification:** 8,409 routine tests passed, 5 skipped, and 2,009 deselected; focused proxy
  transaction and rendering tests passed; Ruff check and format check passed across 769 files.
- **Rendered invariant:** 458 successful CONNECT rows produced 455 exact client-transport joins;
  the three unmatched rows were observation gaps. No joined row had a gross byte mismatch and no
  row without reported sensor loss had a directional mismatch. The 52 residual differences were
  bounded by source-native `missed_bytes`.
- **Automated evaluation:** 96.53944253213886 PASS across 117,110 records (parseability
  99.99914610195543, plausibility 96.93361508524268, causality 94.65558605926869, timing
  93.21199207712195).

- **Deliberation:** triggered by verdict disagreement and a 41-point spread. Revised scores were
  76, 70, 86, and 94; mean 81.50 with unanimous Synthetic verdicts.
- **Target-family disposition:** the loop-74 proxy/Zeek gross byte-accounting contradiction did
  not recur in the rendered probe or any initial expert report.
- **Highest-impact remaining families:** process-owned activity after process termination,
  scenario-date-aware software catalogs, browser/TLS timing modes, UDP syslog sender state,
  source-semantic Samba and workstation lock lifecycles, and host-state-driven Linux background
  texture.
- **Session disposition:** stopped after this loop at the user's request. Loop 76 was not started.

## Post-Loop-75 Targeted Repair Contracts

### Process-owned dependent activity bounded by process lifetime

- **Classification:** `family_level`; Loop 75 `hard_contradiction` across eCAR FLOW, Zeek DNS,
  connection, HTTP, and OCSP evidence attributed to a Linux service-healthcheck process after its
  endpoint termination.
- **Owning abstraction:** the canonical network transaction planner owns process attribution and
  the final transport interval; the activity generator's process-hold registry owns the matching
  termination frontier.
- **Invariant:** every process-attributed canonical connection, including causally expanded DNS,
  TLS, HTTP, and OCSP children, extends its owning process hold through the final connection close;
  rendered dependent activity cannot begin after that process terminates.
- **Entry paths:** baseline and storyline connections, server health checks, browser traffic,
  explicit proxy legs, nested OCSP transactions, direct connection-bundle calls, and suppressed or
  deferred source publication after a committed canonical transport.
- **Consumers:** process finalizers and state, eCAR PROCESS/FLOW rows, Sysmon process/network rows,
  Windows WFP, Zeek protocol logs, source timing, and lifecycle validation.
- **Layer rationale:** the connection planner has the final canonical PID and close time shared by
  every source. Extending the hold there repairs all renderers and causal children without moving a
  termination independently in one output format.
- **Sibling risks:** do not revive stale or unattributed PIDs; preserve authoritative session-end
  bounds, one-shot finalizers, deferred publication recovery, process-less inbound flows, and
  deterministic close jitter.

### Scenario-date-valid application release selection

- **Classification:** `family_level`; Loop 75 `hard_contradiction` across Sysmon process and module
  metadata for Zoom, Webex, and Postman versions released after the March 2024 scenario.
- **Owning abstraction:** the data-driven application catalog owns release validity metadata and the
  deployment compiler owns scenario-date eligibility before installation, assignment, or binary
  identity compilation.
- **Invariant:** an application platform release is eligible only when the scenario collection date
  falls within its catalog validity window; every executable, child, module, installed release,
  and process metadata consumer receives the same eligible release identity.
- **Entry paths:** default catalog compilation, explicitly supplied catalog entries, host and user
  deployment overrides, machine- and user-scoped installations, module compilation, and descriptor
  lookup by executable.
- **Consumers:** deployment/content registries, process generation, Sysmon process and image-load
  records, eCAR software/process rows, installed-software inventory, hashes, and command paths.
- **Layer rationale:** release chronology is deployment truth. Filtering before registry compilation
  prevents future binaries from existing in the modeled world instead of concealing their version
  in Sysmon output.
- **Sibling risks:** retain deterministic catalog order and selection ordinals, allow open-ended
  validity, reject inverted windows, preserve explicit historical catalogs, and avoid suppressing
  OS-native artifacts that share a path with an ineligible application.

### Directory-native Samba browse semantics

- **Classification:** `family_level`; Loop 75 `hard_contradiction` across Samba
  `vfs_full_audit` rows that reported successful `opendir` calls on regular document paths.
- **Owning abstraction:** the SMB activity action bundle owns whether an operation targets a file or
  its containing directory; Samba rendering only maps the canonical event type to a native verb.
- **Invariant:** successful `smb_directory_enumeration` events carry a directory path and no regular
  file identity, size, content version, or file handle; file open/read/close siblings retain the
  selected file's exact identity.
- **Entry paths:** persistent and compatibility SMB browse activities, Windows and Linux clients,
  Windows and Samba servers, explicit file references, path selectors, and baseline browse noise.
- **Consumers:** Samba audit, Windows share/object audit, eCAR FILE rows, SMB channel lifecycle,
  evaluator joins, and rendered path probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the contradiction is created when the action bundle reuses file-oriented
  context for a directory phase. Correcting the canonical phase context keeps all source-native
  projections consistent without teaching the Samba emitter about filename extensions.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve file open/close lifecycle and FUID correlations, share-root browsing,
  POSIX/UNC path conversion, denied operations, state mutation, and transfer byte accounting.

### Source-visible workstation lock lifecycle

- **Classification:** `family_level`; Loop 75 `hard_contradiction` across Windows Security 4800,
  Type 7 4624, and 4801 records compressed and inverted by cross-batch source timing.
- **Owning abstraction:** Windows Security source finalization owns chronological publication of the
  source-native lock state machine after canonical and provider timing have been frozen.
- **Invariant:** for each computer, LogonID, and SessionID, 4800 precedes its matching Type 7 4624,
  which precedes 4801; the visible 4800-to-4801 dwell is at least the configured human-scale
  minimum even when a prior batch advanced the host's rendered clock.
- **Entry paths:** same-batch and deferred cross-hour unlocks, in-memory and spooled finalization,
  baseline and authored transitions, finalized source-timing rows, duplicate suppression, and
  prior-host-clock clamping.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security XML/Snare output, record-ID ordering, session-state evaluation,
  source-timing diagnostics, and blind host review.
- **Layer rationale:** only source finalization sees the complete publication order and retained
  cross-batch host watermark. Repairing the three-row source lifecycle there preserves canonical
  intent while preventing a source-native clock artifact from becoming impossible evidence.
- **Sibling risks:** keep unrelated Type 7 logons untouched, preserve matching LogonID/SessionID,
  avoid duplicate unlock companions, retain deterministic re-auth gaps, and update spool sort keys
  atomically before record IDs are assigned.

## Post-Loop-75 Targeted Repair and Loop 76 Result

- **Implementation classification:** four `family_level` repairs at the canonical network/process
  hold, deployment catalog/compiler, SMB action-bundle context, and Windows Security source-
  finalization owners described above.
- **Behavior contract:** revision 40,
  `612484f5ef8f70dce7a1f34294089f52b865c6efe2f5b7d92d8d3ff145c4976e`.
- **Verification:** 8,413 routine tests passed, 5 skipped, and 2,009 deselected. Focused regression
  tests passed; Ruff check and format check passed across 769 files; all 92 config files validated;
  the scenario remained valid with its existing 24 informational pivot notes.
- **Rendered hard probes:** zero violations across 13,478 process-attributed eCAR rows; 4,797 Zeek
  rows on 3,646 process-owned joined transports; 24 date-bound application Sysmon rows; five
  successful Samba `opendir` rows; and four 4800→Type 7→4801 lock cycles. Minimum visible lock
  dwell was 127.953321 seconds.
- **Automated evaluation:** 96.78058419612987 PASS across 123,267 records (parseability
  99.9991887528698, plausibility 96.89598075580601, causality 95.56852312311956, timing
  93.32350800268763).
- **Blind panel model:** four independent `gpt-5.6-sol` reviewers at high reasoning effort, each
  restricted to the isolated 108-file, 74 MiB review corpus with path-independent SHA-256
  `1b935cc51842d5f97cad8b1b16aed2708229eb3844bd80f5c60e89a1161c2075`.
- **Blind scores:** Threat Hunter 74 (Synthetic, 82 verdict confidence), Detection Engineer 64
  (Synthetic, 76), Network Forensics 74 (Synthetic, 86), and Host/EDR 84 (Synthetic, 88); initial
  mean 74.00. Unanimous verdicts and a 20-point spread did not trigger deliberation.
- **Target-family disposition:** all four rendered probes passed, and no reviewer reported a
  recurrence of the repaired process-lifetime, software-date, Samba-object, or workstation-lock
  contradiction. Host/EDR explicitly validated all four lock cycles; Detection explicitly found
  zero post-termination actor references.
- **Score movement:** loop 76 was 0.25 points below loop 75's initial mean, effectively flat. The
  role-level movement and replacement of hard contradictions with process-population, metadata,
  timing/loss, and host-state texture findings indicate deeper-issue surfacing plus reviewer
  variance rather than a repair regression.
- **Next priorities:** inventory-bound browser/Electron process families and PE identity; causal
  TLS duration and sensor-local loss; host-specific Linux hardware/resolver/cron state; role-bound
  user agents; and complete PE/file analyzer plus build-specific Windows event-version contracts.
