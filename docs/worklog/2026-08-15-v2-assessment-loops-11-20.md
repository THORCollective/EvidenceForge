# V2 Assessment Loops 11–20

## Loop 11 family contract — immutable Windows process authentication context

- **Owning abstraction:** Windows interactive logon/logoff action-bundle lifecycle plus the
  canonical `RunningProcess` authentication identity retained by `StateManager`.
- **Invariant:** A process termination preserves the username, SID, and LogonID established for
  that process at creation. Per-session `winlogon.exe` remains a SYSTEM/`0x3e7` process through
  teardown; the human LUID remains on session/logoff evidence and human-token children.
- **Entry paths:** baseline and storyline local interactive logons, RDP/Type 10 sessions,
  cached-interactive/Type 11 sessions, and late explorer bootstrap repair.
- **Consumers:** Windows Security 4688/4689, Sysmon process lifecycle, eCAR PROCESS
  CREATE/TERMINATE, session teardown ordering, and rendered auth-context probes.
- **Layer rationale:** process authentication identity is canonical process state, while the logoff
  bundle owns termination membership for a session. Rewriting Security or eCAR fields would only
  hide a state-model defect and would leave sibling sources inconsistent.
- **Sibling risks:** the fix must retain explicit teardown of the cross-auth SYSTEM `winlogon.exe`
  helper for both local and remote interactive sessions without terminating a shared boot process
  or losing child-before-parent ordering. Linux post-authentication enrichment is not changed.

## Loop 11 outcome

- Commit `4c7ea566`; full suite `5,959 passed, 22 skipped`; deterministic evaluation
  97.18870689794775 over 90,553 records with acceptance passed.
- The hard probe found zero Security or eCAR winlogon auth-context/session-ID mismatches. The
  targeted family did not recur in blind review.
- Initial blind synthetic-confidence scores were 91/79/74/32 (average 69.0). Deliberation revised
  the panel to 89/75/79/78 (average 80.25), unanimously Synthetic.
- Next target: durable proxy tunnel lifecycle cardinality, with Linux session-scoped parent
  ownership and source-native IPv6/path rendering immediately behind it.

## Loop 12 family contract — durable explicit-proxy tunnel lifecycle

- **Owning abstraction:** `BrowserSessionActionBundle` owns the planned same-origin HTTP request
  group; `ProxyTransactionActionBundle` owns the physical client-to-proxy CONNECT transport and
  its bounded application reuse state.
- **Invariant:** a successful inspected HTTPS tunnel has one durable CONNECT transport identity
  and may carry zero, one, or multiple request occurrences. The physical transport ledger and
  lifetime reserve the browser group's planned request capacity, while every proxy access row
  retains request-local method, URL, body, status, and byte semantics. Reuse never exceeds the
  reserved bytes, request count, close time, host, destination, or user-agent boundary.
- **Entry paths:** ordinary browser page-load groups, route-profile browser sessions, direct
  explicit-proxy HTTPS requests, authored connections, cache hits, denials, and tool/service
  clients. Only browser-style follow-on transactions with explicit group depth may consume a
  planned reusable tunnel.
- **Consumers:** proxy access CONNECT/request rows and tunnel IDs, the client-side Zeek/ASA/eCAR
  transport tuple, source-port allocation, proxy-origin evidence, HTTP transaction depth, and
  deterministic hard probes over request-count distributions.
- **Layer rationale:** the browser bundle already computes group counts, aggregate bodies, and
  group duration; the proxy bundle is the sole owner of explicit CONNECT transport identity and
  capacity. Emitter-side row grouping or fabricated reuse would not repair the canonical
  transport contract.
- **Sibling risks:** do not double-count large uploads, let aggregate tunnel bytes fall below
  visible child rows, reuse across user agents/hosts/errors, move requests beyond transport close,
  or create a second client transport for a reused request. Preserve setup-only and one-request
  paths alongside multi-request groups.

## Loop 12 outcome

- Commits `07882541` and `c13b8e41`; full suite `5,959 passed, 22 skipped` before the
  regeneration-exposed stale-caller follow-up, then focused proxy/session-bound tests passed.
- Deterministic evaluation remained 97/100 over 78,114 records. The hard probe found 498 inspected
  tunnels with depths 1–12, 358 multi-request tunnels, and zero setup, port, or capacity failures.
- The universal one-request proxy finding did not recur. Initial blind synthetic-confidence was
  63/23/34/87 (average 51.75); deliberation revised it to 68/49/46/72 (average 58.75), a mixed
  result with a synthetic lean.
- Next target: decouple cross-host eCAR FLOW observation milliseconds while retaining canonical
  tuple, actor, interval, and auth ordering. PackageKit singleton/identity and PAT allocation
  texture follow.

## Loop 13 family contract — endpoint-local eCAR FLOW observation clocks

- **Owning abstraction:** `SourceTimingPlanner` owns finalized source-native timestamps and
  identity-safety flags for each outbound and inbound eCAR endpoint observation.
- **Invariant:** paired endpoint FLOW views share canonical tuple/interval truth but render in their
  own host-clock frame with independent deterministic collection texture. Each finalized time stays
  inside the corresponding endpoint-clock-translated transport interval; network-sensor clocks do
  not clamp endpoint telemetry.
- **Entry paths:** all canonical baseline, storyline, scanner, browser, proxy, SSH, RDP, SMB, and
  Windows remote-auth connections that route to two modeled endpoints.
- **Consumers:** per-host eCAR FLOW records, actor PROCESS/CREATE floors, SSH/RDP/SMB/remote-auth
  FLOW-before-session ordering, source-window admission, and later endpoint lifecycle anchors.
- **Layer rationale:** canonical network state owns the interval; source timing translates that
  interval to each endpoint clock. The eCAR emitter must render the finalized plan without applying
  a second policy in the canonical or Zeek sensor clock frame.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve actor omission when process visibility is late, exact tuple and
  direction agreement, deterministic reruns, proxy child phase ordering, and independent Zeek and
  Windows timing. Do not extend or rewrite the canonical transport merely to create clock texture.
### Loop 13 outcome

- Fixed endpoint-local eCAR FLOW clock handling in `SourceTimingPlanner` and removed the emitter's second canonical/sensor-clock clamp.
- Verification: 5,962 tests passed, 22 skipped; Ruff checks passed; deterministic evaluation 97/100 over 78,114 records.
- Hard probe: exact-ms endpoint collisions fell to 8/5,520 unambiguous pairs (0.145%), with 2,223 distinct signed deltas.
- Frozen review corpus SHA-256 remained `1e8b1bd7499f285d36ca5fa8aa0e4a20e7f00ac158ded9c266c5aa81be2307c6` before and after blind review.
- Neutral deliberation revised the panel to 61/55/68/64 synthetic-confidence (mean 62), consensus Inconclusive leaning synthetic.
- The endpoint clock-collapse finding did not recur. Next target: canonical host process ownership and service-principal selection; durable SMB transport reuse remains the following strategic target.

## Loop 14 family contract — source-native host process ownership

- **Owning abstractions:** the polkit action family owns the authorizing subject process;
  typed resident-manager/worker service profiles own Postfix and IIS ancestry; the Linux shell
  command bundle owns inferred interactive command children.
- **Invariant:** foreground polkit clients retain the selected interactive principal and visible
  shell parent, resident daemons retain their service principal and singleton identity, Postfix
  SMTP workers descend from one root-owned Postfix master, IIS OWA workers descend from one
  WAS-hosting service process, and every process inferred from interactive bash history descends
  from that exact session shell. One executable path never determines ownership without its
  execution mode.
- **Entry paths:** baseline polkit action messages, PackageKit and NetworkManager authorization
  subjects, inbound/submission/outbound email process attribution, generic mail-server LDAP
  connection ownership, Exchange OWA access, and inferred Linux shell commands including
  service-named diagnostics such as `nginx -t`.
- **Consumers:** canonical `RunningProcess` parent/principal state, eCAR PROCESS CREATE and FLOW
  attribution, polkit syslog PID/owner text, Postfix syslog PIDs, and source-timing parent-before-
  child constraints.
- **Layer rationale:** polkit, service workers, and interactive commands carry different intent
  even when they share an executable name. The action family must supply that intent before the
  canonical process is created; emitter rewrites or a global executable-to-parent table would
  make daemon `nginx` and interactive `nginx -t` mutually contradictory.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve root/systemd ownership for true Linux daemons, do not duplicate the
  seeded NetworkManager, reuse only matching resident service managers, keep pre-window parents
  valid without requiring an in-window CREATE row, retain one-shot worker lifetimes, and avoid
  changing unrelated generic connection-owner or Windows service-singleton behavior.

## Loop 14 outcome

- Commits `120fe082`, `f8135d5c`, `cbdaaab9`, `283c86d1`, `109140fd`, and `fe88555d` implemented
  typed Postfix/IIS ancestry, session-owned inferred commands, and mode-aware polkit subjects.
- Full suite: 5,966 passed, 22 skipped; deterministic evaluation remained 97/100 over 81,281
  records. The service-ownership hard probe found zero visible singleton or ancestry violations.
- Frozen review corpus SHA-256 remained
  `0497a417270b2b8ea1db6ac89e58b87f14cc7bb9ffa2781a42c9b4e23129756a` before and after review.
- Deliberation revised the panel to 55/62/38/43 synthetic-confidence (mean 49.5), with an
  Inconclusive modal verdict. The completed service family did not recur.
- Highest-leverage next target: strict Windows Type 9/NewCredentials semantics. Typed remote-auth
  transport duration remains a prepared follow-on family.

## Loop 15 family contract — typed Windows remote-auth transport texture

- **Owning abstractions:** `WindowsRemoteAuthenticationPlanner` owns the transport interval and
  payload profile for one remote-authentication occurrence; baseline host-activity planning owns
  whether anonymous SMB and machine-account CIFS activity exists at all; the calling action owns
  the destination service selected for a generic Type 3 logon.
- **Invariant:** successful Windows remote-auth transports use deterministic, source/outcome-aware,
  right-skew duration profiles rather than one shared uniform cutoff. Anonymous SMB remains sparse,
  short-lived, unique, and limited to SMB-capable targets. Generic Type 3 logons do not fabricate a
  TCP/445 transport unless their owning activity explicitly identifies SMB; explicit semantic SMB,
  machine-account CIFS, failures, probes, and authored network events retain their own contracts.
- **Entry paths:** generic Windows Type 3 logons, failed remote Type 3 attempts, anonymous network
  logons, machine-account LDAP/CIFS authentication, semantic SMB activities that bind auth to an
  existing transport, baseline service/anonymous noise, and raw scanner or connection events.
- **Consumers:** Zeek/ASA/eCAR transport duration and service distributions, source-port identity,
  Windows 4624/4625/4634 correlation, remote-auth lifecycle plans, host-activity multipliers, config
  validation, and rendered duration/cardinality hard probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the remote-auth planner owns shared canonical transport texture, while
  baseline planning owns event cadence and service eligibility. Fixing Zeek rows or suppressing
  eCAR output would leave the canonical uniform sampler and excess anonymous occurrences intact.
  Conversely, generic Type 3 authentication cannot infer SMB solely from the logon type; the
  caller must declare the backing service when it has one.
- **Sibling risks:** failures, probes, anonymous enumeration, and one-shot administrative activity
  must remain short and newly allocated; semantic SMB must continue using its existing exact
  transport without a duplicate connection; durations must cover authentication ordering without
  creating long-lived sessions by implication; configuration overlays must merge and validate;
  deterministic generation and unrelated RDP/LDAP/Kerberos timing must remain unchanged.

### Loop 15 implementation handoff

- Replaced the shared successful/failed uniform transport-duration sampler with validated,
  overlay-aware lognormal profiles selected by remote-auth source and outcome. Machine-account
  success retains a bounded long tail; anonymous and failed attempts remain short.
- Generic Windows Type 3 logons now require an owning destination port before generating transport
  evidence. Semantic SMB explicitly declares port 445 and continues binding its existing exact
  transaction without a duplicate flow.
- Anonymous SMB baseline noise now uses a scoped deterministic cadence from the Windows auth
  realism config and only targets world-model hosts with `SMB_SERVER` capability; it no longer
  inherits the service-logon activity multiplier.
- Verification: 725 passed, 1 skipped, 1 deselected across the affected unit families and semantic
  SMB integration suite; `eforge validate-config` reported zero issues across 93 files; repository
  Ruff check and format check passed. No generation or blind review has yet been run for Loop 15.

### Loop 15 outcome

- Commit `ffe07d63`; full suite 5,974 passed, 22 skipped. Deterministic evaluation remained 97/100
  over 72,899 records with acceptance passed.
- The remote-auth hard probe passed: core TCP/445 fell from 272 to 127 rows, generic-human Type 3
  fell to zero, anonymous fell to 10, the machine-account tail exceeded 45 seconds, and semantic
  SMB retained 10/10 exact parents without tuple, timing, or endpoint-pair regressions.
- Frozen review corpus SHA-256 remained
  `0e213c88d0ed45e82af6915efaa0308d0e723326ccf3d882af4cb96c3637da73` before and after review.
- Deliberation revised the panel to 78/88/76/82 synthetic-confidence (mean 81), unanimously
  Synthetic. The fixed remote-auth family did not recur.
- New highest-leverage target: validate and repair native UserAssist payload encoding/timestamps,
  followed by application-scoped cache/profile identities. The prepared Type 9 family remains
  Loop 16 because it is a previously adjudicated source-native contradiction already in progress.

## Loop 16 family contract — Windows NewCredentials identity and session ownership

- **Owning abstractions:** the explicit-credential action family owns `runas /netonly` caller,
  outbound credential, and cloned-token identity; the authentication/session bundle admits only
  logon intents with enough facts to build a source-native session; shared Windows logon-type
  predicates own desktop, terminal-session, and local-source capability.
- **Invariant:** Type 9 clones an existing caller's local identity into a new LUID, carries a
  distinct outbound credential identity, has no remote source endpoint, and never creates or
  repairs `winlogon.exe`, `userinit.exe`, or `explorer.exe`. Only Windows Types 2, 10, and 11 are
  desktop-capable. A typed storyline Type 9 resolves the active/assigned desktop user as its local
  caller and the event actor as its outbound identity; ambiguous direct Type 9 requests fail fast.
- **Entry paths:** typed storyline logons and credential sprays, direct `generate_logon` calls,
  explicit-credential events, materialized `runas.exe /netonly` callers, later process-parent
  resolution, session-ID allocation, and successful-logon Security/eCAR projection.
- **Consumers:** canonical `ActiveSession` and `AuthContext`, Windows Security 4624/4648 fields,
  eCAR USER_SESSION identity/source properties, Security/Sysmon/eCAR process trees, logoff state,
  validation diagnostics, and rendered NewCredentials correlation probes.
- **Layer rationale:** caller identity, alternate outbound identity, source locality, and desktop
  capability are shared semantic truth. The action/session layer must own them before rendering;
  suppressing Explorer in one process path or rewriting self-IP in one emitter would preserve the
  contradictory canonical session and allow another entry path to recreate it.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve desktop bootstrap for Types 2, 10, and 11; preserve network/service
  parentage for Types 3 and 5; keep Types 4 and 8 non-desktop; keep Type 7 as re-authentication of
  an existing interactive LUID; retain Windows RDP and Linux SSH bundle ownership for Type 10;
  and do not turn every 4648 from PsExec, WMI, or scheduled tasks into Type 9.

### Loop 16 implementation handoff

- Added canonical outbound credential and cloned-caller identity, centralized Windows desktop and
  source predicates, and made Type 9 local, non-terminal, and non-desktop across state and lazy
  parent resolution.
- Materialized `runas.exe /netonly` explicit-credential activity now owns correlated 4648 and Type
  9 evidence; other explicit-credential tools do not. Existing typed Type 9 authoring remains
  compatible by resolving the host's active/assigned local desktop user as caller and the event
  actor as outbound identity. The benchmark scenario was not changed.
- Full suite: 5,997 passed, 22 skipped after correcting baseline's unsupported random Type 9 sample
  and synchronizing the canonical/public scenario references. Scenario validation passed with the
  existing 25 warnings; Ruff lint and formatting checks passed.
- A clean rendered probe found exactly one Type 9 on WS-AJOHNSON with local Aisha, outbound Marcus,
  `seclogo`/Negotiate, dash source/port, matched Security/eCAR LUIDs, and zero Type-9-owned
  `winlogon.exe`, `userinit.exe`, or `explorer.exe`. All rendered Type 2/10 siblings retained shell
  evidence; Type 11 remains covered by the focused state matrix.

### Loop 16 outcome

- Commit `52346e69`; deterministic evaluation remained 97/100 over 72,869 records with acceptance
  passed. The final NewCredentials hard probe passed every identity, source, lifecycle, and desktop
  sibling gate.
- Frozen review corpus SHA-256 remained
  `e6b384ce2ab14341de320253436dacba10476a896eb6480df031353789246d06` before and after review.
- Initial blind synthetic-confidence was 23/32/31/79. Deliberation revised it to 43/45/35/68
  (mean 47.75), an Inconclusive consensus. The Type 9 contradiction did not recur.
- Next targets: the already-started UserAssist native encoding repair, then application-scoped
  cache identities. Shell/TTY ownership and narrow TLS duration texture follow from this panel.

## Loop 17 family contract — canonical UserAssist and binary registry effects

- **Owning abstractions:** the registry-effect producer owns the occurrence timestamp, process,
  principal/session, value type, and canonical value bytes before dispatch; shared EDR pool
  materialization owns source-independent binary structure construction; Sysmon and eCAR remain
  source-native projections of that one canonical effect.
- **Invariant:** every modern UserAssist payload is one 72-byte v5 structure whose little-endian
  FILETIME at offset 60 is nonzero and no later than its owning registry occurrence. Repeated
  state for one host/user/value never moves its execution time or counters backward. Explorer
  shell artifacts retain the matching user's live `explorer.exe` and session ownership. Binary
  registry values never leak `.reg` export syntax into Sysmon; eCAR may retain useful canonical
  bytes without inventing a second value.
- **Entry paths:** ambient workstation registry noise and process-owned registry side effects,
  including overlay-provided UserAssist templates. DHCP-coupled HKLM writes remain outside the
  UserAssist family but continue using the shared registry-effect representation.
- **Consumers:** canonical `RegistryContext`, Sysmon Event 13 target/details projection, eCAR
  REGISTRY values and process provenance, registry-state deduplication, config validation, and
  rendered payload/ownership hard probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the defect is created before dispatch when a fixed-calendar UserAssist
  FILETIME is generated without the occurrence time. An emitter-only rewrite would leave sibling
  sources contradictory, while a baseline-only repair would miss process-side effects. The shared
  materialization/registry-effect boundary is the smallest layer that covers every producer.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve deterministic RNG behavior where practical; do not lose HKU/SID
  projection, process/session provenance, or useful eCAR detail; do not make historical shell
  state look like a new application execution; avoid counter regression and duplicate UserAssist
  weighting; keep `AccentPalette` a 32-byte binary palette and PIDL MRUs binary rather than
  four-byte strings when those low-risk siblings share the same owner.

### Loop 17 implementation handoff

- Added one occurrence-aware registry-effect materializer used by ambient, DHCP, and process-side
  producers. Modern UserAssist values remain 72-byte v5 payloads, but their offset-60 FILETIME now
  comes from the canonical occurrence rather than a fixed March 2024 interval. Process-side
  coverage confirms Explorer image, principal, and logon ownership are preserved.
- Added canonical registry value typing. Sysmon renders REG_BINARY Event 13 details opaquely as
  `Binary Data`, while eCAR retains the shared space-delimited canonical bytes. Removed the
  duplicate UserAssist pool entry and `.reg`-export strings; AccentPalette is now 32 bytes and
  PIDL/RecentDocs values use bounded binary shapes.
- Focused verification: 793 passed and 1 skipped across EDR pools, Sysmon, eCAR, baseline, and
  activity tests. The rendered projection tests prove opaque Sysmon binary details and retained
  eCAR bytes; non-March and repeated-time probes prove UserAssist FILETIME ordering. An additional
  76 canonical-context, EDR-diversity, and source-timing tests passed. `eforge validate-config`
  reported zero issues across 93 files. The full suite passed with 6,006 tests and 22 skips after
  making the multipart acceptance sensor explicitly lossless and allowing contract-valid omitted
  SMB FLOW actor identity when the client process is not yet source-visible. Repository-wide Ruff
  lint and formatting checks passed. No full scenario generation, evaluation, blind review, or
  commit has been run.

### Loop 17 outcome

- Commit `a487e795`; deterministic evaluation remained 97/100 over 77,125 records and passed all
  hard acceptance criteria. The rendered hard probe matched 51/51 UserAssist values across
  Sysmon/eCAR with zero future FILETIMEs and passed every AccentPalette/PIDL/RecentDocs gate.
- Frozen review corpus SHA-256 remained
  `768a414a06551e5d90bdd9ab09388a59d3ca2c532129febea63ce08ce3bcff44` before and after review.
- Initial blind synthetic-confidence was 63/43/28/47. Deliberation excluded post-window and
  bounded-completeness claims and revised the panel to 47/45/30/47 (mean 42.25), an Inconclusive
  consensus at 80 confidence.
- The UserAssist contradiction did not recur. The next highest-leverage valid finding is the
  cross-host 2.168–2.286-second public-key SSH authentication band, owned by SSH lifecycle timing.

## Loop 18 family contract — typed SSH authentication-phase timing

- **Owning abstraction:** `SshSessionActionBundle` owns the canonical transport-to-authentication
  lifecycle; the activity timing profile owns the data-driven method, route, key, cache, backend,
  and receiver-state distributions used to plan that lifecycle.
- **Invariant:** transport and destination eCAR FLOW evidence remain visible before the accepted
  authentication event, which remains before PAM session-open and logind session creation. The
  connection-to-accept phase has deterministic scoped variation appropriate to authentication
  method and execution context, including a realistic fast path and a non-uniform slow tail;
  replaying the same SSH action produces the same timestamps.
- **Entry paths:** baseline organic administration, CI/configuration/backup/SCP traffic, typed
  storyline SSH and SCP sessions, compatibility Type 10 Linux logons, and direct public generator
  calls all converge on the same SSH action bundle and timing sampler.
- **Consumers:** destination syslog `Connection`/`Accepted`/PAM/logind rows, canonical SSH session
  readiness, eCAR USER_SESSION and FLOW ordering, responder/client process visibility, deferred
  closure, state-manager session metadata, and rendered cross-source timing probes.
- **Layer rationale:** the narrow band is produced when the shared eCAR-observation floor dominates
  the small public-key gap, collapsing otherwise sampled values. The bundle must add the typed
  authentication work after that required visibility floor; changing only syslog rendering would
  contradict canonical readiness and sibling eCAR/session evidence.
- **Sibling risks:** do not move transport or eCAR FLOW behind authentication; do not orphan the
  destination sshd actor when its source-visible create is delayed; preserve PAM/logind order and
  close-after-session semantics; avoid global RNG coupling; keep password and public-key
  distributions distinct; and bound slow-tail samples so short transports extend coherently rather
  than closing before login.

### Loop 18 implementation handoff

- Added typed, overlay-aware SSH authentication profiles with fast, typical, and slow-tail work,
  plus deterministic route, receiver-load, credential-cache, and public-key-type factors. The SSH
  bundle now adds that work after the endpoint-FLOW visibility floor instead of allowing the floor
  to collapse otherwise sampled public-key sessions into one timing band.
- Focused timing/SSH/config coverage passed 584 tests with one skip; `eforge validate-config`
  reported zero issues across 93 files and Ruff/diff checks passed. The full repository suite
  passed with 6,010 tests and 22 skips. One unrelated SMB acceptance tolerance was aligned with
  the documented two-second independent endpoint FLOW/FILE source-latency envelope.

### Loop 18 generation-regression follow-up

- Added validated `ssh_authentication` timing profiles for password and public-key fast, typical,
  and slow-tail paths plus credential-cache misses, private/public route RTT, receiver load, and
  ED25519/ECDSA/RSA costs. Sampling uses a bundle-scoped stable seed and does not consume the
  process-global generation RNG.
- The SSH bundle now adds the sampled authentication work after the eCAR FLOW/collection
  visibility floor instead of allowing that floor to replace it. All baseline, world-planner,
  typed-storyline, compatibility-logon, and direct-generator entry paths continue to converge on
  this one action owner. Existing transport -> connection -> accepted -> PAM -> logind and closure
  constraints remain authoritative.
- Focused verification: 192 timing/SSH/config tests passed; 392 broader world-model, baseline,
  logoff, storyline, source-timing, and dispatcher tests passed with 1 skip. Population tests prove
  exact replay, a public-key spread exceeding three seconds with both fast and slow-tail samples,
  method differentiation, and route/key contextual effects. The lifecycle test proves the sampled
  phase remains additive after the shared FLOW floor. `eforge validate-config` reported zero
  issues across 93 files; repository Ruff lint and formatting checks passed. No generation, blind
  review, commit, benchmark scenario edit, or generated-artifact edit was performed.
- Authoritative generation initially exposed two lifecycle interactions. Moving the auth sample to
  a scoped RNG had removed one historical shared-stream draw and shifted later baseline session/SCP
  planning; the bundle now consumes that compatibility draw without using it for rendered timing.
  More fundamentally, a slow authentication phase left the session identity canonically anchored
  at TCP-open time, so source-visible login plus the full pre-auth interval could push an otherwise
  valid close beyond the lifecycle tail. The SSH session occurrence and StateManager session now
  start at the bundle-owned PAM session-open anchor; TCP transport retains its independent earlier
  start and duration.
- Added regression coverage for exact shared-RNG budget preservation under password and public-key
  auth, and for a forced 20-second auth phase under enterprise collection with a session shell and
  deferred close. The focused SSH/timing/world suite passed 144 tests, repository Ruff and diff
  checks remained clean, and authoritative iteration-test generation completed all six hours and
  replaced output successfully. The benchmark scenario itself was not edited.

### Loop 18 rendered-probe observation follow-up

- The first rendered hard probe found one boundary-open SSH USER_SESSION whose exact target inbound
  eCAR FLOW was missing. The observation policy's generic network lifecycle key took precedence
  over its existing remote-session tuple key, so transport and login could receive independent
  eCAR missingness decisions.
- Remote SSH/RDP tuple coherence now precedes generic per-occurrence lifecycle grouping. A focused
  17:58 boundary-open regression proves the network transport and endpoint login share one eCAR
  admission decision. Regeneration restored the exact target FLOW and the rendered probe passed all
  20 public-key sessions with zero tuple or actor-before-create mismatches.

### Loop 18 outcome

- Commits `d7fec6d6`, `00026dfa`, and `4a8bdd7d`; final full suite 6,014 passed with
  22 skips. Evaluation scored 97.39/100 over 77,130 records. The hard probe passed 20/20 public-key
  sessions with a 2.114-second range, 20 unique timings, exact eCAR FLOW-before-session and syslog
  lifecycle ordering, and three boundary-open cases.
- Frozen corpus SHA-256 remained
  `9480d8c1abe4a8980519c659157142a4a3f7cf67206e5577cdba51c0d0550a1c` before and after review.
  Deliberation excluded post-window/completeness claims and revised panel scores to 74/66/72/78
  (mean 72.5), unanimous Synthetic at 82 confidence.
- The SSH latency band did not recur. The next P0 is one in-window source-client process/transport
  inversion; deterministic first-answer DNS selection is the broadest distribution artifact.

## Loop 19 family contract — SSH source-client process-before-transport ownership

- **Owning abstractions:** `SshSessionActionBundle` owns one resolved source-client process before
  it delegates TCP/22 to the canonical network-connection contract; the process-execution bundle
  owns the canonical start and source-native CREATE deadlines for that client and its shell parent.
- **Invariant:** a modeled Windows or Linux SSH client starts canonically before its transport and
  every visible source-native CREATE for that client is no later than the source transport
  observation it can own. The target connection, accepted-authentication, PAM, and session-open
  lifecycle remains after transport. If source observation latency cannot satisfy attribution,
  the FLOW drops actor identity rather than moving transport or authentication later.
- **Entry paths:** baseline organic administration, CI/configuration/backup/SCP traffic, typed
  storyline SSH and SCP sessions, compatibility Type 10 Linux logons, direct bundle calls, and
  both Windows OpenSSH and Linux `ssh`/`scp` source processes.
- **Consumers:** canonical process state, Windows Security/Sysmon/eCAR PROCESS CREATE, Linux eCAR
  PROCESS CREATE and bash history, endpoint eCAR FLOW actor identity, Zeek transport identity,
  target sshd/syslog lifecycle, process termination, and session-boundary admission.
- **Layer rationale:** the inversion is created when generic human-spacing moves a newly created
  source client beyond the already-owned transport anchor. The SSH action must request a causal
  process deadline and the process owner must honor it; emitter rewrites would leave canonical
  process/socket order contradictory and source projections mutually inconsistent.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve ordinary human-scale spacing outside causal connection ownership,
  parent-before-child source timing, deterministic replay, unique per-transport SSH clients,
  boundary-open sessions, FLOW-before-target-login/PAM ordering, actor omission for genuinely late
  source visibility, session end bounds, and source client termination after transport close.

### Loop 19 implementation handoff

- Confirmed the inversion at the process owner: a causal Windows SSH client was initially placed
  before TCP open, but the generic repeated-command and bare-interactive-shell spacing passes could
  move its canonical start beyond the already-fixed transport anchor. Process requests with an
  explicit source-visibility deadline now bypass only those optional human-spacing passes; normal
  one-shot commands retain their existing spacing. The same deadline is propagated to a newly
  materialized Windows CLI shell so parent and child CREATE projections remain ordered.
- Focused Windows coverage forces a future repeated-`ssh.exe` spacing reservation and proves the
  source client still starts and is source-visible before TCP/22, followed by target accepted-auth
  and PAM open. Linux coverage forces a busy foreground shell and proves the equivalent ordering
  without moving transport. The world-planner regression now requires the safely visible source
  client to remain the canonical initiating PID while retaining close-before-termination bounds.
- Verification: 78 focused SSH/source-timing tests passed; 856 broader activity, SSH, timing,
  storyline-command, process-lifecycle, world-model, and baseline tests passed with 1 skip.
  `eforge validate-config` reported zero issues across 93 files. Targeted Ruff lint, format, and
  diff checks passed. The full repository suite passed with 6,015 tests and 22 skips. No scenario,
  generated corpus, blind artifact, or commit was changed.

## Loop 20 family contract — polkit authorization process identity and visibility

- **Owning abstractions:** the baseline polkit action family owns one authorization occurrence,
  including its subject process, invoking principal, authentication principal, outcome, and
  authorization timestamp; the canonical process-execution bundle owns source-visible CREATE
  timing for that already-resolved process identity.
- **Invariant:** an in-window polkit authorization row may reference a modeled PID only after that
  PID's eCAR PROCESS/CREATE is visible on the same host clock. Foreground CLI subjects retain the
  selected invoking principal and a same-principal visible shell parent; resident PackageKit and
  NetworkManager subjects remain root-owned singletons. Successful authorization authenticates as
  root while reporting the canonical subject owner; explicitly failed reboot authorization does
  not fabricate a successful privilege transition or a mismatched initiator.
- **Entry paths:** workstation and server extra-syslog polkit entries, foreground `systemctl`,
  `loginctl`, `pkcon`, `nmcli`, and `timedatectl` clients, resident `packagekitd` and
  `NetworkManager` subjects, registered/unregistered desktop-agent messages, and boundary-start
  fallback PID allocation.
- **Consumers:** canonical `RunningProcess` ownership and parentage, eCAR PROCESS/CREATE and
  PROCESS/TERMINATE rows, polkit `unix-process:PID:start-time` subjects, authentication/owner text,
  bash/session ancestry, and source-observation timing.
- **Layer rationale:** the contradiction is created when the polkit family emits a dependent
  syslog occurrence without telling the process bundle that CREATE must be source-visible first,
  while independently sampled template principals can disagree with the chosen subject. The
  authorization owner must pass one resolved context into process construction and rendering;
  emitter timestamp or string rewrites would leave canonical ownership and sibling evidence
  inconsistent.
- **Sibling risks:** preserve source-native collection latency outside dependent ordering, process
  parent-before-child visibility, daemon singleton reuse, short foreground lifetimes, explicit
  failed-reboot semantics, desktop-agent session/bus texture, scenario-boundary admission,
  deterministic RNG use, and non-polkit process spacing.

### Loop 20 implementation handoff

- Added one immutable polkit authorization plan that resolves action, subject process, invoking
  owner, authentication principal, and outcome together. Foreground CLI processes now consume the
  same subject owner rendered in polkit text; successful elevation authenticates as root, while
  explicitly failed reboot attempts retain the invoking subject instead of sampling an unrelated
  principal. Resident PackageKit/NetworkManager subjects remain root-owned.
- Propagated the polkit dependency deadline through the visible Linux shell and CLI process. Loose
  user shells without a modeled logon now start before their child rather than being synthesized
  after the requested activity. Source-timing identity finalization reuses the process bundle's
  already-constrained eCAR CREATE observation instead of replacing it with an unconstrained
  sample.
- The rendered invariant test proves same-principal shell ancestry and
  `shell CREATE < CLI CREATE <= polkit timestamp`; sibling tests cover daemon reuse, successful
  versus failed authentication identity, unsuccessful reboot semantics, and desktop-agent
  behavior. Focused polkit coverage passed 9 tests; broader activity, source-timing, baseline, and
  system-traffic coverage passed 668 tests with 1 skip. Targeted Ruff lint, format, and diff checks
  passed. No config, scenario, generated corpus, blind artifact, or commit was changed.

### Loop 19 outcome

- Commit `640c6f82`; evaluation remained 97.3908/100 over 77,150 records. The rendered source-side
  SSH contract passed: all 27 attributed FLOW rows had exact same-host client CREATE evidence at or
  before the FLOW, with zero PID/image/command/Sysmon mismatches and zero later matching client
  creates. Two permitted actor omissions remained.
- The broader SSH probe exposed a separate target-side timing issue: 2/29 target eCAR FLOW rows
  followed their receiver syslog Connection line by 438–709 ms. Transport/client termination and
  target-session closure checks otherwise passed, with five boundary-open closures excluded.
- Frozen corpus SHA-256 remained
  `556224e2a34f45e9dfe7b6743c65bbe3b2feaa26573121eaf67b4becd53e082c` before and after review.
  The 37-point initial panel spread triggered deliberation; revised scores were 70/74/58/72
  (mean 68.5), unanimous Synthetic. The fixed source-client inversion did not recur.
- The next P0 is the repeated same-host polkit future-PID contradiction. Durable machine-account
  TGT/cache state, stable Kerberos negotiation profiles, recurring SCM-owned PowerShell jobs, WMI
  dynamic-RPC lifecycle, TLS negotiation metadata, and target SSH FLOW/syslog ordering remain
  prioritized follow-ups.

### Loop 20 outcome

- Commit `bf544d16`; the full suite passed with 6,016 tests and 22 skips. Evaluation remained
  96.9929/100 over 78,789 records. The rendered foreground polkit invariant passed all 19/19
  observable host+PID cases, including CREATE-before-authorization, path/owner identity, shell
  ancestry, authentication principal, and later termination. Four unmatched PackageKit subjects
  were resident daemons with no visible in-window CREATE and are boundary-neutral, not causal
  failures.
- Frozen corpus SHA-256 remained
  `22f29eb2b98a19f3232736ab9e0bb7faa44e7050e5e4b987bc2eb106f1f9fda4` before and after review.
  The 44-point initial panel spread triggered deliberation; revised scores were 76/65/74/71
  (mean 71.5), unanimous Synthetic at 81.25 average verdict confidence. The repaired polkit
  future-PID contradiction did not recur.
- The higher score versus loop 19 reflects newly surfaced independent defects rather than a fix
  regression. Next priorities are Linux session-ID mutation/logon-ID reuse, client-exclusive DNS
  millisecond quantization, invariant SMB transfer arithmetic, recurring SCM-owned PowerShell
  maintenance, and detached PSEXESVC file lifecycle timing.
