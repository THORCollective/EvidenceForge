# EvidenceForge Implementation Plan

**Status:** 2.1.2 release preparation; post-v2.1.1 realism fixes merged to dev
**Started:** 2026-03-11
**Last Roadmap Review:** 2026-09-24

This file is the durable roadmap and backlog. It is not a session worklog. Use
tracked files under [docs/worklog](docs/worklog) for multi-session effort notes,
loop-by-loop assessment history, handoffs, and branch-local progress details.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for release history and completed-phase details.

## Completed Milestones

**2.0.1 cleanup and correctness.** Simplified generation ownership and shared infrastructure,
corrected foreground lifecycle, resolver selection, and Kerberos timing, and repaired long-run
SSH checkpoint identity retention. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#v201-2026-09-14).

**Phase 1: Core Generation.** Pydantic scenario models, StateManager, Windows
Event Security and Zeek conn.log output, hour-by-hour generation engine, and
ground truth documentation.

**Phase 2: Scalability.** Parallel threaded emitters, 7 log formats, persona
temporal distribution, network visibility modeling, and multi-OS support.

**Phase 3: Initial Product Release.** Skill-based scenario/generate/validate/evaluate
workflow, prebuilt personas, skill installation, and scenario reference docs.

**Phase 4: Data Quality Evaluation.** `eforge eval` with deterministic scoring,
source-instance-aware parsers, inferred narrative pivots, acceptance criteria,
and exact correlated-IDS integrity gating.

**Phase 5: Data Realism Improvements.** Major generator-level realism fixes for
identity, protocol, process, temporal, and baseline noise patterns.

**Phase 7: Canonical Event Model.** SecurityEvent intermediate representation,
composable contexts, dispatcher routing, and migrated core event families.

**Phase 8.x: Action Bundles and HostContext.** Architecture reset work moved
cross-source lifecycle ownership into action bundles, temporal/source observation
contracts, and dual source/destination HostContext support. Detailed branch and
assessment history belongs in worklogs and changelog entries, not this roadmap.

**Scenario 2.0 and composable packs.** Added optional industry/organization packs,
immutable per-run effective configuration, exact and provenance-rich composition,
authoritative resolved scenarios, run manifests, sample packs, and pack/resolve CLI
workflows. See the
[scenario composition worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-14-scenario-pack-composition.md).

## Quality Roadmap

Current goal: fix analyst-rejection issues and finish remaining quality work
without turning `TODO.md` back into a high-conflict work journal.

### Active and Near-Term

- [x] **P1** Preserve Windows facts in Snare and validate its native representation. All 43 variants
  have typed projections and field-level gates against both frozen SOF-ELK revisions; historical
  ambiguity remains explicit. See the [validation worklog](docs/worklog/2026-09-15-record-validation.md).
- [ ] **P2** Follow up upstream Snare extraction limitations: ParentImage/CurrentDirectory patterns
  require backslashes after the pipeline replaces them, and POSINT patterns omit zero ports.
  EvidenceForge preserves these raw values; structured indexing needs upstream parser work and
  renewed compatibility gates. No upstream changes are part of this branch.
- [ ] **P1 — deferred** Investigate the existing iteration-scenario temporal-integrity failure
  (40/48 visible events, 83.33%, below the unchanged 85% gate). Separate expected-time matching,
  ordering, missing traces, and source-observation timing before assigning fixes to their owning
  layer. Baseline/candidate evidence bytes match; this predates the validation refactor and is
  deferred from this branch by user decision. See the same worklog for the eight findings.
- [ ] **P2** Investigate generation coverage for Zeek packet-filter/reporter/weird diagnostic
  sources separately from their dedicated renderer/parser/validator fixture coverage.

- Prepare the 2.1.2 release from `dev` to `main`, including the version/changelog bump and routine,
  coverage, slow, and checkpoint portability gates. See the
  [release worklog](docs/worklog/2026-09-24-2.1.2-release.md).
- [x] **P2** Implement native Windows NTFS generation and checkpoint recovery, with passing
  Windows/Linux routine CI and local macOS validation in PR #419. Existing POSIX implementations
  remain in place. See [platform details](docs/design/native-windows-filesystem.md) and the
  [validation worklog](docs/worklog/2026-09-14-windows-ci-checkpoints.md).
- [ ] **P2** Require `Required CI` through dev branch protection. The workflow aggregates Linux,
  Windows, and lint successfully, but dev currently has no protection or effective branch rules.
  Main already requires `Required CI` and `Required Release CI`; preserve those protections.

- [x] **P1** Add source-instance-aware evidence reachability validation so impossible persistent
  SMB output selections fail before generation, invisible authored behavior produces actionable
  warnings, and runtime `--formats` narrowing rechecks the same canonical contracts. See the
  [evidence reachability worklog](docs/worklog/2026-09-09-evidence-reachability-validation.md).

- [x] **P1** Complete the Pack Schema 2.0 release workflow: publisher-qualified identities,
  deterministic lock refresh, immutable `.efpack` closure import/hydration, resilient all-scope
  inventory, updated skills, and small/medium healthcare consumers. See the
  [Pack Schema 2.0 release workflow worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-26-pack-schema-2-release-workflow.md).

- [x] **P1** Build dedicated pack-management, industry-pack, and organization-pack authoring
  skills and integrate pack discovery/consumption with the scenario, config, and validation
  workflows. The implementation adds runtime-effective public catalogs, stable JSON validation and
  provenance, safe init/copy lifecycles, and six successful clean-room authoring trials. See the
  [pack-authoring skills worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-14-pack-authoring-skills.md).
- [x] **P1** Complete realism-remediation Batches 0–2: approve the canonical contracts, add the
  behavior-preserving contract foundation, and implement the session/process/authentication
  vertical slice. See the [approved contracts](docs/design/realism-review/contract-proposals.md),
  [foundation worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-05-canonical-contract-foundation.md), and
  [session/authentication worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-05-session-auth-lifecycle.md).
- [x] **P1** Run the isolated four-specialty blind panel against the post-Batch-2 integrated
  output and verify material findings. The six originally targeted contradictions remain cleared,
  but the panel exposed validated sibling lifecycle defects; see the
  [panel summary](docs/design/realism-review/post-batch-2-blind/summary.md).
- [x] **P1** Close the failed post-Batch-2 blind gate before Batch 3: repair host-scoped Linux PID
  allocation, SSH responder process-observation ordering, Windows module startup/compatibility
  timing, and Windows EventRecordID rate modeling, then regenerate and repeat the isolated panel.
  The bounded gate passed after five repair loops; see the
  [final panel summary](docs/design/realism-review/post-gate-loop5-blind/summary.md).
- [x] **P1** Implement Batch 3, the network/protocol/IDS vertical slice: make the network plan
  authoritative for source-visible intervals, protocol/file children, and IDS eligibility, with
  full/filter/parallel projection-equivalence tests. This targets `REAL-005`, `REAL-007`, and
  `REAL-009`. See the [Batch 3 worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-07-network-protocol-ids.md) and
  [empirical results](docs/design/realism-review/batch3-results.json).
- [x] **P1** Implement Batch 4 world-capability and distribution-state contracts for `REAL-008`
  and `REAL-012`, including the remaining AAAA and OCSP distribution findings. See the
  [Batch 4 worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-07-world-capability-distribution-state.md) and empirical
  results package.
- [x] **P1** Implement Batch 5 source-native projection and evaluator-validity work for
  `REAL-010` and `REAL-011`, including the evaluator proof gaps recorded by Batch 4. See the
  [Batch 5 worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-07-projection-evaluation-validity.md) and
  [empirical results](docs/design/realism-review/batch5-results.json).
- [x] **P1** Complete Batch 6 input-safety, workload-budget, authoring, and reproducibility work,
  including the deferred evaluator-memory capacity decision (`REAL-013`, `REAL-014`,
  `SEC-001` through `SEC-010`, and `SEC-DEFER-001`). See the
  [Batch 6 worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-07-input-safety-budgets.md) and
  [empirical results](docs/design/realism-review/batch6-results.json).
- [x] **P2** Complete behavior-preserving Batch 7a compatibility cleanup: enforce closed dispatch
  admission, remove observed-time state feedback and duplicate sensor NAT maps, delete unreachable
  event aliases, refresh the path census, and reconcile architecture/scenario/evaluation/security
  documentation. See the [Batch 7 worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-07-compatibility-documentation.md)
  and [results](docs/design/realism-review/batch7-results.json).
- [x] **P2** Implement the approved direct Batch 7b migration: replace the mutable event carrier,
  flat `NetworkContext`, `EdrContext` identity fields, TLS/X.509/OCSP/proxy/file views, singular IDS
  input, and sequence-derived event IDs without internal compatibility layers. Preserve the CLI,
  authored schema, and source formats; version the ground-truth schema. Optimize indexed lookup
  speed while proving duration-stable retained state. See the Batch 7 worklog for the approved
  implementation contract and [Batch 7b results](docs/design/realism-review/batch7b-results.json).
- [x] **P1** Close the post-Batch-7b effectiveness gate before opening the cumulative PR to `dev`:
  repair the controlled SSH source-order regression, inbound Windows 5156 local-process ownership,
  file/application/transport loss accounting, clock-derived Linux PID allocation, and missing SSH
  close ownership. The definitive repeat is byte-identical, the expanded probe is clean, and the
  requested blind panel is complete. See the
  [effectiveness report](docs/design/realism-review/post-batch7b-effectiveness/REPORT.md).
- The complete dependency order and acceptance boundaries remain in the
  [final review report](docs/design/realism-review/final-report.md#dependency-ordered-remediation-roadmap);
  exact evidence, owners, remediation, and tests remain in
  [the machine-readable finding register](docs/design/realism-review/findings.json).
- [x] **P1** Complete the V2 family-level realism foundations: scalable indexed state,
  execution/effect reconciliation, append-only lifecycle authority, one timing/clock runtime,
  compiled deployment/content identity, explicit collection policy, and persistent application
  channels. Preserve legacy authored inputs through boundary normalization and prove flat lookup,
  bounded retention and deterministic output, then record a fresh blind-panel measurement. The
  final automated score is 96.8965 and the frozen blind average is 75.75: 6.25 points worse than
  the immediate Loop 30 baseline, but 17.5 better than the later post-P1 checkpoint. See the
  [implementation worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-16-v2-family-foundations.md) and
  [final assessment](docs/design/realism-review/v2-family-foundations-final/REPORT.md).
- [x] **P2** Switch `proxy_access.log` from W3C Extended format to Apache/Nginx
  combined-style output with absolute URLs and CONNECT targets, with target-specific parser
  compatibility coverage.
- [ ] **P2** Review shared Windows Event XML helper opportunities across
  Security and Sysmon emitters without hiding provider-specific field semantics.
- [x] **P2** Add output-target ingest guides covering which generated sources
  are parsed and normalized, parsed-only, unsupported, and how to ingest each
  target-specific dataset.
- [x] **P1** Add focused machine-readable `eforge schema` selectors, executable minimal examples,
  actionable grouped validation diagnostics, and staged authoring guidance while retaining focused
  references as the semantic authoring guide.
- [x] **P1** Before the final 2.0.0 release, reconcile the roadmap and release documentation:
  retire completed or stale TODO items, align the README proxy-format description with the
  implemented combined-log output, update Ruff's target to Python 3.12, and clear release-tree
  whitespace and working-copy hygiene issues.

Recently completed: Codex fix-family PR review/rework, full slow-suite
regression cleanup, architecture reset validation, output-target extraction,
source timing planner work, identity-directory and endpoint host-clock realism,
long-scenario duration-stable state and syslog spooling, and Host/EDR reviewer-1
fixes for journald sparsity, polkit role gating, remote command ownership,
Windows maintenance cadence/runtime, and source-aware LSASS call traces. Keep
further per-loop or per-PR details in worklogs or PR descriptions.

### Correctness and Realism Backlog

- [ ] **P2** Design and implement general authored entity availability/participation controls
  across all evidence families. Support entities appearing during a scenario without generating
  earlier activity merely because they are declared in the environment; the motivating case is
  FOR668 `scenario-3_1`'s rogue device appearing before its intended arrival. Apply the mechanism
  through canonical planning and lifecycle owners across warmup, baseline, storyline, causal
  prerequisites, and source/destination selection, rather than DHCP-specific checks or filtering
  rendered rows. Define physical presence separately from collection visibility, and preserve
  realistic evidence from other entities (such as failed attempts to reach an absent host).
  Cover exact activation boundaries, correlated evidence, lifecycle transitions, and checkpoint
  resume; retain existing behavior when controls are omitted. Document supported authoring and
  limitations in the scenario/configuration skills. Final schema and scope remain design work.
- [x] **P2** Bind ambient Linux `systemd-resolved` traffic to each host's selected DNS
  resolvers. The cross-host syslog pass now reuses the correct pool, with address-only evidence
  corrections and compatible checkpoint recovery verified. See the
  [cleanup worklog](docs/worklog/2026-09-12-behavior-preserving-cleanup.md#host-specific-resolver-correction--complete).
- [x] **P1** Make process-to-file and process-to-registry effects actor-native by construction.
  Data-driven executable eligibility and canonical process/session ownership now cover Defender,
  WER, CBS, Office MRU, UserAssist, and shell-state artifacts, with PID/ProcessGuid correlation
  checks. The dedicated Loop 41 assessment and Loop 42 target confirmation found no recurrence; see
  `docs/worklog/2026-08-09-iteration-test-expanded-ids-loops-35-44.md`.
- [x] **P1** Finish executable-aware lifetimes for one-shot Windows foreground tools. Typed
  preflight plans now distinguish bounded, operation-, session-, and persistent ownership;
  argument-less/help/error `runas`, `git`, and `kubectl` close promptly, while transfers and
  continuous modes retain only their real owner.
- [x] **P2** Separate the collection cutoff from the modeled lifecycle horizon. The scenario end
  means "we stopped collecting data," not that systems shut down or every active connection,
  session, process, and application operation ended cleanly. Mirror warm-up behavior at the tail:
  allow lifecycles that start before the exclusive collection end to remain active afterward,
  emit only source-native rows actually observed before the cutoff, and do not synthesize an
  in-window close, logoff, teardown, or completion merely to drain runtime state. Decouple the
  output window from network leases, application/channel registry bounds, lifecycle journals, and
  terminal zero-owner assertions; finalize an explicit active-at-cutoff snapshot and then release
  its runtime ownership safely. Decide during design whether ground truth records only
  `active_at_collection_end` or also retains the exact modeled future close. This must not be used
  to conceal pathological durations such as runaway SMB file-size growth, which remains a
  separate root-cause fix. Implemented by retaining exact modeled future deadlines internally and
  admitting only source-native observations before the exclusive collection cutoff; see
  `docs/worklog/2026-09-08-collection-lifecycle-boundary.md`.
- [x] **P1** Honor authored cross-event `process_ref` / `parent_ref` lifecycles. Keep a referenced
  parent alive through dependent child creation, prevent independent storyline jitter from
  inverting same-time parent/child events, and preserve a live authored source for subsequent
  process-access effects instead of silently recording `no_live_source_process`. Implemented with
  release-aware named-process retention, exact-parent admission, and authored group ordering; see
  `docs/worklog/2026-09-09-storyline-parent-snort-route-identity.md`.
- [x] **P1** Canonicalize sensor identity before assigning Snort and sibling sensor output routes.
  TEST1 had one authored `IDS-NG-EDGE` sensor whose raw and canonical hostname aliases resolved to
  the same physical path on case-insensitive filesystems. Emitter setup now consumes the canonical
  source hostname while exact-publication collision checks remain strict for distinct sensors; see
  `docs/worklog/2026-09-09-storyline-parent-snort-route-identity.md`.
- [x] **P1** Add source-side file-read, archive, browser-upload, or
  proxy-client staging evidence around large outbound HTTP POST/upload flows so
  multi-hundred-MB uploads have plausible endpoint preparation and ownership.
- [x] **P1** Finish Windows inbound/server-side endpoint network telemetry for DC/server roles.
  Canonical initiator/responder observation plans now render responder-owned Security 5156 and
  deployed Sysmon Event 3 with `Initiated=false`, exact tuple/process identity, and coherent
  denial/deployment/observation-policy behavior.
- [x] **P1** Finish public-IP role partitioning. The canonical public identity registry now owns
  deterministic role/provider bindings for scanners, authentication, C2, humans, crawlers, API
  clients, ordinary responders, CDN, DNS, NTP, and mail, including DNS/PTR/TLS/client traits and
  explicit sharing diagnostics.
- [x] **P1** Model Windows Security and Sysmon `EventRecordID` gaps against
  plausible hidden event volume while preserving near-adjacent native pairings
  such as Security `4624`/`4672` and tightly coupled Sysmon process events.
- [x] **P2** Validate and improve Sysmon `ProcessGuid` morphology against
  native Sysmon output while preserving stable process correlation.
- [ ] **P2** Make UDP/123 Zeek output consistently include or omit NTP analyzer evidence according
  to modeled sensor configuration. NTP infrastructure/server identities are now separated from
  hostile scanners by the canonical public identity registry.
- [x] **P1** Improve public PTR, TLS, and provider realism. Public PTR responses are now
  deterministically sparse and provider-style rather than forward-hostname echoes; domain-aware CA
  overrides keep SNI/certificate issuer relationships plausible, and raw-IP TLS avoids invented
  SNI and public-CA DNS identities. Covered by public-DNS, TLS, certificate, and raw-IP regressions.
- [x] **P2** Add true HTTP multipart transactions with ordered/nested parts,
  per-part size/MIME/filename/FUID metadata, envelope overhead, curl form parsing,
  multiple correlated local file reads, proxy legs, and span-aware loss. See the
  [research/implementation record](docs/worklog/2026-08-12-http-multipart-zeek-research.md).
- [ ] **P2** Add HTTP range identity and reassembly for 206 and
  `multipart/byteranges`, including cross-transaction and cross-connection FUID
  reuse, sparse offsets, instance size, overlap, and missing-range semantics.
- [ ] **P3** Add explicit HTTP chunked/content-coded multipart framing. Model
  chunk layout and Zeek weird behavior separately from semantic parts, and model
  top-level gzip/deflate before enabling these authored combinations.
- [x] **P2** Replace inferred SMB/445 file behavior with canonical Windows SMB2/3
  storage activity: reusable sessions/trees, share mappings and mount paths,
  stateful file operations, native Zeek SMB/file projection, and correlated
  Windows/eCAR evidence. Generic connection events remain transport-only. See the
  [SMB redesign worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-13-smb-redesign.md).
- [x] **P2** Extend canonical SMB2/3 disk-share activity to explicit Linux clients and Samba
  servers: mounted CIFS and direct `smbclient` modes, POSIX paths, ext4/XFS backing storage,
  mixed-platform mapping presentations, distinct actor/credential/effective identities,
  profile-gated Samba audit evidence, cross-platform Zeek/eCAR projection, and storage manifest
  schema v2. GVFS remains background transport texture rather than typed file activity. See the
  [Linux SMB support worklog](docs/worklog/2026-08-14-linux-smb-support.md).
- [ ] **P3** Add generalized Zeek `kerberos.log` and `ntlm.log` projections across
  applicable authentication protocols, including SMB, with sensor-visibility and
  encryption semantics; do not implement SMB-private authentication emitters.
- [ ] **P3** Evaluate capacity/free-space, quotas, disk-full outcomes, deduplication,
  sparse allocation, and storage compression for the bounded canonical catalog.
- [ ] **P3** Expand SMB failure and lifecycle texture beyond common outcomes,
  including stale mappings and interrupted or partial operations.
- [ ] **P3** Extend SMB authorization with optional dual share/NTFS ACLs, inheritance
  and deny ordering, per-path ACLs, and public SACL/audit-policy authoring.
- [ ] **P3** Add optional actor-native SMB endpoint companions for MRU state,
  antivirus scans, search indexing, and backup-agent activity, gated by host role,
  installed software, and collection profile.
- [ ] **P3** Evaluate higher-fidelity Zeek SMB file analysis against native pcaps,
  including compatible cross-operation FUID reuse, span/offset aggregation, timeout
  finalization, and partial MIME/hash semantics; implement only analyst-visible value.
- [ ] **P3** Optionally materialize SMB file artifacts and richer physical/semantic
  lineage from canonical metadata/version state without requiring artifacts for
  standard datasets; evaluate durable recursive directory mutation separately.
- [ ] **P2** Add typed RAR archive creation with explicit source-file membership, archive content
  identity, source-to-archive lineage, and process-owned endpoint evidence so later SMB/HTTP/FTP
  transfers preserve the exact staged archive rather than inferring it from a command line.
- [ ] **P3** Extend canonical SMB beyond the completed Windows/Linux SMB2/3 disk-share slice as
  scenario demand warrants: SMB1, DFS, IPC$/named-pipe/print, clustering,
  leases/oplocks/durable handles, byte-range locks, multichannel/RDMA/QUIC, KSMBD, SMB POSIX
  extensions, typed GVFS activity, optional Linux Audit/kernel-CIFS diagnostics, and advanced
  dialect/signing/authentication or server-wide encryption controls.
- [ ] **P3** Add typed FTP upload/retrieval with authentication, `RETR`/`STOR`, exact local and
  remote paths/results, archive/content identity propagation, correlated control and negotiated
  data channels, `ftp.log`, and file analysis whose byte direction follows the actual transfer.
- [ ] **P3** Add TLS client-certificate/mTLS profiles with client chains,
  `client_cert_chain_fuids`, X.509/file projection, and TLS-version-specific
  visibility semantics.
- [ ] **P3** Remove the 2.x public-identity compatibility adapters and legacy overlay filenames in
  EvidenceForge 3.0 after migration telemetry and documentation have had a full major-version
  window.
- [ ] **P3** Evaluate a typed Scenario schema field for scenario-local public identity bindings in
  a future schema revision; 2.0 intentionally keeps this project-wide registry overlay-only.
- [ ] **P2** Add friction and timing texture to staged intrusion/exfiltration
  chains, including retries, failed commands, dwell-time slack, partial cleanup,
  tool residue, competing benign traffic, and less perfectly staged large-file
  handoffs.
- [ ] **P2** Add perimeter TLS imperfection for public-facing services,
  including missing SNI, IP-literal/default scanner SNI, malformed handshakes,
  failed handshakes, and reset outcomes tied to scanner/client families.
- [ ] **P3** Continue de-rating uniform Windows endpoint startup palettes,
  especially repeated `gpupdate.exe` and clustered VPN/ZTNA tray launches on
  DC/server roles.
- [ ] **P2** Add session-aware RDP baseline texture so repeated remote desktop
  activity reconnects, replaces, or reuses sessions instead of stacking many
  concurrent client launches to DC/file-server roles.
- [ ] **P2** Diversify Linux/eCAR temporary file paths by process family, user,
  daemon role, and OS convention instead of reusing generic `/tmp` and
  `/var/tmp` templates across unrelated processes.
- [ ] **P2** Reduce exact-hour proxy and update bursts, keep browser/User-Agent
  families consistent per host/session, vary Linux cron/sysstat schedules by
  host history, and add realistic network collection imperfections such as
  occasional Zeek `missed_bytes`, incomplete TLS/x509 companion evidence, and
  less curated IDS alert clustering.
- [ ] **P2** Remove source-native network timing and loss lattices: avoid preserving identical
  microsecond residues through integer-millisecond protocol offsets, model directional capture gaps
  more often than symmetric `Gg`, and render response-triggered IDS alerts with response direction.
- [ ] **P2** Track SOF-ELK HTTPD parser handling of domain-qualified and
  machine-account proxy usernames. The SOF-ELK target currently strips the
  Windows domain prefix from `DOMAIN\user` and the trailing `$` from `machine$`
  auth tokens because SOF-ELK's HTTPD grok rejects those values; if SOF-ELK
  accepts them later, revisit whether the SOF-ELK combined text target should
  preserve the full value like the default target does.
- [ ] **P3** Polish proxy/web application semantics for SaaS token endpoints,
  MIME/status combinations, scanner request texture, and selective large-file
  extraction imperfection.
- [ ] **P2** Improve DNS TTL texture by binding public and internal TTLs to
  resolver/cache/domain-family behavior instead of broad low-value randomization
  outside explicitly suspicious DNS-tunnel activity.
- [ ] **P2** Bind endpoint software inventory, module-load noise, and registry
  side effects to host role/cohort; avoid repeated writes to static uninstall
  metadata such as `DisplayName`, `Publisher`, and `DisplayVersion`, especially
  on server and domain-controller roles.
- [ ] **P2** Improve eCAR `FLOW` actor semantics so rows with PIDs either carry
  coherent process/principal context or intentionally omit actor identity when
  endpoint attribution is unavailable.
- [x] **P2** Enforce Zeek file/connection timing contracts so `files.log` rows
  referencing a connection UID land inside that visible connection interval, or
  the connection timing expands to cover the file observation.
- [ ] **P2** Improve Linux eCAR thread semantics so `tid` is populated from a
  plausible thread model or omitted when unavailable instead of copying `pid`
  across every Linux flow/file/process row.
- [ ] **P2** Make SSH eCAR session login/logout tuple fields symmetric when the
  transport tuple is known, including `src_port` on both sides of the same
  `objectID`.
- [ ] **P2** Tighten Linux SSH command/process-to-transport timing so most LAN
  SSH commands reach the TCP/22 connection in sub-second to low-single-digit
  seconds, reserving longer gaps for DNS, retries, or explicit delay.
- [x] **P1** Bind Linux bash-history command sequences to concrete SSH or local session intervals.
  Commands are fitted to visible session windows or suppressed when no owner exists, including
  serialized commands after session close; the Loop 238 hard probe checked 202 commands with zero
  outside syslog/eCAR session intervals. See
  `docs/worklog/2026-05-current-dev-assessment-continuation.md`.
- [ ] **P2** Reduce direct root/password SSH volume and model routine Linux
  administration through bastions, named admin users, sudo, and service
  automation instead of repeated polished interactive root access.
- [ ] **P2** Align DHCP syslog renewal promises with the next DHCPREQUEST/ACK
  schedule and vary source-native syslog timestamp suffixes within renewal
  triplets.
- [ ] **P2** Add per-host endpoint observation jitter for paired source and
  destination eCAR `FLOW` rows so cross-host endpoint observations do not land
  on the same millisecond by default.
- [ ] **P2** Normalize eCAR service-process principal attribution so the same
  actor/pid does not alternate between missing and populated principal identity
  without an explicit collection profile reason; for proxies, separate local
  daemon ownership from original client/user attribution.
- [ ] **P2** Enforce monotonic bash-history timestamps per file unless modeling
  multiple shell sessions explicitly, and filter incomplete shell constructs
  such as standalone `if` from generic command pools.
- [ ] **P2** Diversify LDAP discovery command texture by tool, filter, user,
  host role, and result/failure pattern so repeated `ldapsearch` reconnaissance
  does not appear as one procedural command pool across many hosts.
- [ ] **P3** Validate SSH `Accepted publickey` syslog formatting against native
  OpenSSH variants and include key type/fingerprint details when configured.
- [ ] **P3** Validate Windows Security Event ID 1102 rendering against real
  exported XML and ensure audit-log-clear subject/account fields appear in the
  correct native structure.
- [ ] Ground truth File IOCs section truncated in `GROUND_TRUTH.md` output.
- [ ] Add RFC 5737 validation warnings for realism-bound scenario fields such as
  `public_cidrs`, NAT `mapped_ip`, storyline `source_ip`/`dst_ip`, and DNS
  `answer_ip`.
- [ ] Replace or data-drive recognizable `45.33.32.x` public IPs remaining in
  built-in scan/attacker pools.
- [ ] Add non-intercepting proxy mode. Current proxy behavior assumes TLS
  interception, so HTTPS proxy logs can include CONNECT plus inspected request
  rows.
- [ ] Align proxy format/auth realism with common enterprise products:
  standard Squid/Blue Coat-style output and authenticated usernames where
  appropriate.
- [ ] Expand ASA message type diversity beyond 106023, 302013-16, and 305011-12.
- [ ] Add SSH protocol negotiation messages.
- [ ] Fix DLL files rendered as `NewProcessName` in Windows 4688 events.
- [ ] Fix 4648 targets that render as localhost instead of the DC for domain
  commands.
- [x] Render 4728 `MemberName` as the added member DN instead of `-`.
- [x] Add Windows 4778/4779 RDP reconnect/disconnect evidence.
- [ ] Model integrity levels well enough that Mimikatz at Medium integrity does
  not appear to succeed unrealistically.
- [ ] Add configurable per-host/source log deployment coverage for named host
  groups, disabled sensors, partial deployments, and collection windows.
- [x] **P2** Profiled long-scenario generation and removed duration-growing
  connection, session, process/thread, expiry, Linux PID, logind, and
  multi-host syslog retention paths. See
  [the long-scenario performance worklog](docs/worklog/2026-07-27-long-scenario-performance.md).

## Future Enhancements

### Short-Term

- [ ] Configurable work-week schedules and per-persona day-of-week overrides.
- [x] Storyline cadence field: `human`, `automated`, or periodic interval with
  jitter.
- [ ] Cloud/SaaS log formats: Azure AD, AWS CloudTrail, GCP audit logs, and M365.
- [x] Correlated multi-SID IDS attachments on typed transport-owning events,
  including connections, beacons, remote sessions, DHCP, scans, and DNS activity,
  with sensor-local Snort-style alert filtering and reporting.
- [ ] Extend correlated IDS attachments to typed `email_message` and `email_read`
  events so asserted SIDs follow the real mail transports produced by modeled
  routing and sensor placement. IDS sensors do not currently decrypt traffic;
  before implementation, decide whether STARTTLS and implicit TLS suppress every
  candidate or permit signatures classified as detectable from flow,
  pre-encryption, or TLS metadata. Plaintext mail is eligible only when a
  storyline or background path explicitly asserts a signature.
- [ ] HTTP proxy server support for Squid, Blue Coat, and Zscaler.
- [x] **Checkpointing and resume for long-running generation.** Cadence-only incremental
  checkpoints now preserve bounded live state and immutable deltas, atomically retain two
  recoveries, resume portably, and reproduce byte-identical deterministic bundle content. The
  selected default is 24 simulated hours. See
  [the incremental checkpoint worklog](docs/worklog/2026-09-02-incremental-generation-checkpoints.md).
- [x] **Behavior-aware, attemptable checkpoint resume and exact-behavior recovery.** Runtime and
  environment drift now attempts full hydration, while immutable run identity, OOB authorization,
  integrity, and unsupported state contracts remain hard boundaries. Declared behavior history
  distinguishes localized, material, and unknown output risk; successful non-exact restoration
  migrates at the same cursor with complete provenance. Lifecycle restoration distinguishes
  aged-out parents from cycles and restores large retained graphs in near-linear time. See the
  [compatible-resume worklog](docs/worklog/2026-09-06-compatible-checkpoint-resume.md).
- [ ] Consolidate checkpoint-capable emitter spools into the protected
  `.eforge-generation/` workspace. Active spools intentionally remain in their established
  runtime locations for the initial checkpoint release; revisit placement only after production
  experience confirms the incremental adapters are stable.
- [ ] Additional skills: create-persona, create-log-format, create-network, and
  analyze-output.
- [ ] Example scenario collection for ransomware, credential stuffing, and
  insider threat.
- [ ] Config file inheritance/templating.
- [ ] Overlay `_replace: true` recursive propagation for nested lists.
- [ ] Overlay `_delete: true` for removing built-in entries.
- [ ] Subset sensor format support, such as `log_formats: [zeek, -zeek_dns]`.
- [ ] PyPI package distribution.
- [ ] Network diagram ingestion for auto-inferred sensor placement.
- [ ] Performance optimizations such as Rust extensions or better parallelism.
- [ ] Full user directory export as separate CSV.
- [ ] Separate student/instructor output packages.

### Medium-Term

- [ ] Automate clean-room scenario-agent acceptance after the 2.0 release, measuring first-draft
  structural validity, passes to zero errors, required-reference loading, warning churn, and
  repair regressions across representative scenario families. Use manual scenario-authoring
  acceptance for the 2.0 release candidates and final release.
- [ ] Web UI for scenario creation.
- [ ] Streaming output to SIEM/data lakes.
- [ ] Log format auto-detection from samples.
- [ ] D3FEND defensive response modeling through scenario defense profiles.
- [ ] ML-informed baseline profiles from sanitized real logs.

### Long-Term

- [ ] OT/ICS environment simulation.
- [ ] Real-time log streaming mode.
- [ ] Collaborative scenario editing.
- [ ] Scenario marketplace.
- [ ] Integration with attack frameworks such as CALDERA and Atomic Red Team.
- [ ] High-performance generation mode for enterprise-scale scenarios.

## Field Test Gaps

Gaps identified from FOR668/FOR669 exercise data comparisons. Completed cluster
details should live in changelog or worklogs; only remaining implementation work
is tracked here.

### Configurable Bulk Events and DNS Independence

- [ ] DGA algorithm presets for known malware families.
- [ ] Dictionary-based DGA using word-combination domains.
- [ ] `active_hours` / `active_days` on periodic event types.
- [ ] Connection to non-listening host (`REJ`/`S0` without firewall deny).

### Resolved Clusters

Format filtering is implemented via `--formats` and `format_groups`.
Temporal-baseline phase needs are handled by composing existing bulk primitives.
Windows auth enrichment covered broader 4648 generation, 4800/4801, and
storyline lock/unlock specs. Labeled data export remains out of scope because it
requires real-world labeled domains.

## Maintenance Notes

- Read this file at the start of each repo session.
- Do not edit this file for routine "started", "in progress", or "completed"
  task status. Use a tracked worklog for multi-session memory instead.
- Update this file only for durable roadmap/backlog changes, milestone
  completion, priority changes, or release/integration reconciliation.
- When a phase is fully complete, summarize it here and move detailed history to
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) or a focused worklog.
