Generate realistic synthetic security logs for cybersecurity threat hunting training and research.

For background on the project and why we built it, read our announcement:
[Introducing EvidenceForge: synthetic security logs that don't look (as) fake](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/introducing-evidenceforge-synthetic-security-logs-that-dont-look-as-fake).

## What Makes EvidenceForge Different

Most synthetic log generators produce isolated, single-format data that experienced analysts identify as fake within seconds. EvidenceForge takes a fundamentally different approach:

- **Consistency by construction.** A canonical `SecurityEvent` model feeds all log formats from a single source of truth. Two emitters cannot disagree about a port number, timestamp, or LogonID because there is only one value — on the event object. This eliminates the cross-source inconsistencies that are the #1 tell of synthetic data.

- **Causal event ordering.** Events respect real-world dependencies — DNS queries precede connections, Kerberos TGT/TGS precede domain logons, audit events follow administrative commands. A composable rule engine auto-generates prerequisites with realistic timing offsets, so the data tells a coherent causal story across log sources.

- **Self-exciting temporal dynamics.** User activity follows a Hawkes process — events trigger bursts that taper off naturally, matching real human work patterns. System traffic uses periodic intervals with jitter. Day-of-week variation models Monday login storms, Friday early departures, and near-zero weekends. Most generators use uniform random timing that experienced analysts spot instantly.

- **20+ correlated log formats.** Windows Security (30 event IDs), Sysmon, 13 Zeek log types, eCAR EDR/XDR, macOS eslogger (Endpoint Security), syslog, bash history, Snort IDS, web access, and proxy logs — all from the same event pipeline.

- **Network visibility modeling.** Define sensor placement (SPAN/TAP), monitored segments, and direction. EvidenceForge determines which connections each sensor can see and only emits network logs where they'd realistically appear.

- **Deterministic engine, LLM-assisted authoring.** Scenario creation uses Claude Code Skills for interactive, research-backed attack planning. Log generation is fully deterministic — no LLM calls, no API costs, reproducible output every time.

- **Built-in quality evaluation.** A 4-pillar scoring framework (20 sub-scores) measures parseability, plausibility, causality, and timing. Know exactly how good your data is before using it.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/EvidenceForge.git
cd EvidenceForge
uv sync

# Install project-local skills for all supported agents
uv run eforge install-skills

# Or select one agent or install user-wide
uv run eforge install-skills --agent chatgpt
uv run eforge install-skills --global

# Create a scenario interactively
# /eforge scenario

# Or generate from an existing scenario
uv run eforge generate scenarios/branch-office-example/scenario.yaml -o ./output

# Validate a scenario file
uv run eforge validate scenarios/branch-office-example/scenario.yaml

# Evaluate generated data quality
uv run eforge eval ./output/data --scenario scenarios/branch-office-example/scenario.yaml
```

## Agent Skills (Recommended)

EvidenceForge includes agent skills for interactive, guided workflows. These are the preferred way to use EvidenceForge.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/eforge scenario` | Guided scenario creation through a structured interview. Researches TTPs via MITRE ATT&CK, builds environment/network/personas, outputs validated YAML + student context document. |
| `/eforge generate` | Validates the scenario, runs the generation engine, monitors output, and diagnoses errors. |
| `/eforge validate` | Checks a scenario for schema correctness and cross-reference integrity. Fixes simple issues, escalates structural problems. |
| `/eforge evaluate` | Runs the data quality evaluation, interprets scores, reviews records for realism, and suggests improvements. |
| `/eforge config` | Add, modify, or remove personas, domains, applications, and other configuration data. Handles cross-file dependencies automatically. See [Customizing Configuration](docs/reference/CUSTOMIZING_CONFIG.md). |

`uv run eforge install-skills` installs project-local skills for both Claude Code
and ChatGPT. Claude commands go under `.claude/commands/`; ChatGPT skills go
under `.agents/skills/`. Add `--global` to install both user-wide under
`~/.claude/commands/` and `~/.agents/skills/`, or select one with `--agent
claude` or `--agent chatgpt`. The legacy name `--agent codex` remains an alias
for `--agent chatgpt` and uses the same destinations.

## CLI Reference

For scripted or non-interactive use:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `eforge generate <scenario.yaml> -o <dir>` | Generate logs from a scenario file |
| `eforge validate <scenario.yaml>` | Validate scenario schema and cross-references |
| `eforge eval <output_dir> -s <scenario.yaml>` | Evaluate data quality (4 pillars, 20 sub-scores) |
| `eforge info [field]` | Show installation info, config paths, and data inventories. Pass a dot-path field for a specific value (e.g., `eforge info personas`). Use `--fields` to list available fields, `--json` for machine output. |
| `eforge validate-config` | Validate config files for cross-reference integrity. Use `--json` for machine output. |
| `eforge install-skills [--agent all\|claude\|chatgpt\|codex] [--global]` | Install project-local or user-wide agent skills; defaults to all agents (`codex` aliases `chatgpt`) |
| `eforge version` | Show version |

Useful command flags: `generate` accepts `--verbose` / `--debug` for logging,
`--output` / `-o` for output directory overrides, `--force` / `-f` to overwrite
existing output without prompting, and `--target default|sof-elk|splunk` to choose the
generated file layout. The `default` target is SIEM-neutral; `sof-elk` emits
target-specific variants such as Snare Windows events and year-partitioned
RFC3164 syslog for parser validation, and `splunk` emits Splunk-friendly
Windows XML event streams. `eval` uses `--scenario` / `-s` and
`--format text|json`; `info` and `validate-config` support `--json` for machine
output.

All commands accept `--help` and `-h` for usage information.

## Customizing Configuration

EvidenceForge ships with 50+ YAML config files controlling DNS domains, applications, personas, traffic profiles, and more. You can customize these using a project-local overlay at `.eforge/config/` — your changes survive package upgrades and merge automatically with built-in defaults.

The recommended approach is the Claude Code skill:

```
/eforge config add a nurse persona for a healthcare scenario
```

For details on the overlay system, manual editing, and cross-file dependencies, see **[Customizing Configuration](docs/reference/CUSTOMIZING_CONFIG.md)**.

## What It Does

EvidenceForge creates multi-format security log datasets from YAML scenario definitions. You describe an environment (users, systems, network topology) and a storyline (attack events), and EvidenceForge generates temporally consistent logs across all formats simultaneously — complete with cross-referenced LogonIDs, PIDs, timestamps, and UIDs.

Every generated scenario includes a `GROUND_TRUTH.md` file. Attack scenarios document exactly what happened, when, and where, while baseline-only scenarios explicitly document that no malicious events were generated.

### Key Capabilities

- **Cross-log consistency** — Shared LogonIDs, PIDs, timestamps, and Zeek UIDs across all formats
- **Causal expansion engine** — Auto-generates prerequisite events (DNS, Kerberos, audit events) with composable rules
- **Realistic baseline noise** — 26 lateral movement patterns, process→network correlation, network-level red herrings, and 18 Linux syslog categories create noise that analysts must work through
- **OS-aware generation** — Windows systems produce Windows Event + Sysmon logs; Linux systems produce syslog + bash history; macOS systems produce eslogger (Endpoint Security) NDJSON
- **Network visibility modeling** — Define sensor placement (SPAN/TAP), direction, and monitored segments
- **Ground truth documentation** — Every run generates a GROUND_TRUTH.md; attack scenarios include narrative, timeline, and IOCs
- **Parallel generation** — Threaded emitters write all formats simultaneously with temporal consistency
- **Scenario validation** — Cross-reference checking, uniqueness constraints, and network topology validation
- **Data quality evaluation** — 4-pillar scoring framework (20 sub-scores) with acceptance criteria
- **Multi-timezone support** — Pattern-based timezone overrides per system hostname

## Scenario Structure

Scenarios are YAML files describing an environment, personas, time window, and optional attack storyline:

```yaml
version: "1.0"
name: my-scenario
description: "Description of the scenario"

environment:
  description: "Corporate office network"
  timezone:
    default: "America/New_York"
  users: [...]
  systems: [...]
  network:             # Optional: segments and sensors
    segments: [...]
    sensors: [...]

personas: [...]        # User behavior patterns

time_window:
  start: "2024-01-15T08:00:00Z"
  duration: "8h"

baseline_activity:
  description: "Normal office activity"
  intensity: medium
  variation: low

storyline:             # Optional: attack events
  - time: "+2h"
    actor: attacker
    system: TARGET-01
    activity: "Lateral movement via pass-the-hash"
    events:
      - type: process
        process_name: "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"
        command_line: "cmd.exe /c whoami"

output:
  logs: [{format: windows_event_security}, {format: zeek}]
  destination: ./output
```

See [Scenario Reference](docs/reference/scenario-reference.md) for complete schema documentation.

## Example Scenarios

| Scenario | Users | Duration | Description |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|
| [branch-office-example](scenarios/branch-office-example/scenario.yaml) | 5 | 6 hours | Beginner branch office scenario with Windows, Zeek, eCAR, syslog, bash history, Snort, ASA, web, and proxy logs |
| [macos-eslogger-demo](scenarios/macos-eslogger-demo/scenario.yaml) | 3 | 2 hours | Three-hunt macOS Endpoint Security demo (AMOS/Atomic Stealer, DPRK BeaverTail, CloudMensis-style persistence) with `eslogger` + Zeek egress correlation |
| [minimal.yaml](tests/fixtures/scenarios/minimal.yaml) | 1 | 1 hour | Minimal baseline-only scenario |
| [attack.yaml](tests/fixtures/scenarios/attack.yaml) | 2 | 4 hours | Lateral movement + exfiltration |
| [retail-store-ftp-attack.yaml](tests/fixtures/scenarios/retail-store-ftp-attack.yaml) | 20+ | 24 hours | Retail store with FTP RCE attack, full network topology |

## Data Quality Evaluation

EvidenceForge includes a built-in evaluation framework that scores generated data across 4 pillars:

| Pillar | Weight | What it measures |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Parseability | 30% | Spec conformance, format constraints |
| Plausibility | 25% | Value/OS correctness, co-occurrence, distributions, user diversity, anomaly rate |
| Causality | 25% | Causal ordering, event presence, indicator accuracy, pivot linkability |
| Timing | 20% | Attack-chain timing, burstiness, diurnal patterns, volume adequacy |

**Two-tier acceptance**: hard gates (minimum, must pass) + aspirational targets (stretch goals, informational). Hard gates: Spec Conformance ≥ 95%, Value Plausibility ≥ 95%, Causal Ordering ≥ 90%, Event Presence ≥ 85%. Thresholds are configurable in `src/evidenceforge/config/evaluation/thresholds.yaml`.

```bash
uv run eforge eval ./output -s scenario.yaml
```

## Architecture

```
Scenario YAML
    |
    v
Validation (Pydantic schema + cross-reference checks)
    |
    v
GenerationEngine (hour-by-hour orchestration)
    |
    v
WorldModel / WorldPlanner (compile host roles, user placement, session bootstrap)
    |
    v
ActivityGenerator (builds SecurityEvents with composable contexts)
    |
    v
EventDispatcher (routes to StateManager + matching emitters)
    |
    +---> WindowsEventEmitter ---> default XML / sof-elk Snare / splunk XML stream
    +---> SysmonEmitter ---------> default XML / sof-elk Snare / splunk XML stream
    +---> ZeekEmitter(s) --------> sensor/conn,dns,http,ssl,... (NDJSON)
    +---> EcarEmitter -----------> ecar.json (NDJSON)
    +---> SyslogEmitter ---------> default+splunk RFC5424 / sof-elk RFC3164 year layout
    +---> BashHistoryEmitter ----> per-user bash history
    +---> SnortEmitter ----------> snort_alert.log
    +---> CiscoAsaEmitter -------> default+splunk flat / sof-elk year layout
    +---> WebEmitter ------------> web_access.log
    +---> ProxyEmitter ----------> proxy_access.log
```

Generation records the selected output target in `OUTPUT_TARGET.txt` and
emitters apply it only where file shape differs.

`WorldModel` compiles authoritative host and user capabilities from scenario fields like `primary_system`, `roles`, `services`, and workstation assignments. `WorldPlanner` then chooses realistic interactive, network, SSH, and RDP session paths before `ActivityGenerator` emits the correlated evidence.

See [Architecture Documentation](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full deep dive including the world-model layer, SecurityEvent model, state management, and emitter system.

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies and development tools
uv sync --all-extras

# Run tests without coverage instrumentation (skips slow by default)
uv run pytest --no-cov

# Run slow comprehensive workload tests without coverage instrumentation
uv run pytest --include-slow -m slow --no-cov --durations=20

# Run optional third-party parser validation tests.
# Requires Docker Compose v2 or Podman Compose.
uv run pytest --include-external-parsers -m external_parser --no-cov

# Run the release coverage gate before a dev -> main PR
uv run pytest --cov=evidenceforge --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=70

# Do not combine slow tests with coverage during release validation.
# Slow tests are run with --no-cov; coverage is measured on the default non-slow suite.

# Run specific test suite
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_network_visibility.py -v

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```
