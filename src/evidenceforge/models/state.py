"""Runtime state models for EvidenceForge.

This module defines dataclass containers for tracking runtime state during log generation.
Unlike the Pydantic models in config.py and scenario.py, these use standard Python
dataclasses since they are runtime containers, not input validation models.

No validation is performed in these dataclasses - they are mutable containers for
runtime state tracking.
