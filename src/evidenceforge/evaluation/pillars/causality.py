"""Pillar 3: Causality scoring.

Sub-scores (weights sum to 1.0):
  causal_ordering        (0.25): Known before/after pairs are correctly sequenced.
  event_presence         (0.20): Storyline events leave at least one trace.
  indicator_accuracy     (0.15): Found traces carry correct IPs/usernames/hostnames.
  pivot_linkability      (0.15): Consecutive attack steps share a pivotable indicator.
  temporal_integrity     (0.15): Events timed and ordered correctly.
  storyline_trace_coverage (0.10): All expected format-groups have traces.
