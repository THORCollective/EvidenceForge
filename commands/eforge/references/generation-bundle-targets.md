Read this reference when the question is about generated paths, authoritative artifacts, target
rendering, replacement scope, or bundle integrity. Read a family-specific evidence reference for
record fields and source behavior.

## Bundle Layout

One successful current run writes one matched bundle. Some source files only exist when their
format, topology, or feature is active.

```text
<bundle-root>/
  data/
    <hostname.domain>/
      windows_event_security.xml
      windows_event_sysmon.xml
      ecar.json
      syslog.log
      bash_history/<username>.bash_history
      web_access.log
      proxy_access.log
      <year>/windows_event_security_snare.log
      <year>/windows_event_sysmon_snare.log
      <year>/syslog.log
    <sensor-name>/
      conn.json
      dns.json
      http.json
      ssl.json
      files.json
      smtp.json
      ...
    <ids-sensor-name>/snort_alert.log
    <firewall-name>/cisco_asa.log
    <firewall-name>/<year>/cisco_asa.log
  artifacts/email/<artifact-id>.eml
  GROUND_TRUTH.json
  GROUND_TRUTH.md
  OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json
  COLLECTION_PROFILE.json
  STORAGE_MANIFEST.json
  ARTIFACTS_MANIFEST.json
  OUTPUT_TARGET.txt
  RESOLVED_SCENARIO.yaml
  GENERATION_MANIFEST.json
  ENVIRONMENT.md
```

`data/`, both ground-truth files, the observation manifest, collection profile, output-target
marker, resolved scenario, and generation manifest are core current outputs. The storage manifest,
artifact manifest, and `artifacts/` appear only when applicable. `ENVIRONMENT.md` is optional
authored collateral; generation does not create it.

`GROUND_TRUTH.json` is canonical and `GROUND_TRUTH.md` is its human-readable projection.
`RESOLVED_SCENARIO.yaml` is the self-contained authoritative generation input. It no longer needs
the authored include graph, packs, project configuration, or discovery directory. It remains
generated/non-editable and cannot authorize live callbacks.

`GENERATION_MANIFEST.json` is the run identity and is committed last. It records the effective
target, seed, formats, runtime/build identity, selected pack identities and digests, resolved-file
hash, and output hashes. An absent manifest means the current transactional bundle did not finish
successfully. A copied bundle must keep every hashed file with this manifest.

## Compiled Collection Identity

Before rendering, generation compiles the requested formats into immutable exact source instances
and fixed capability sets. Canonical projection targets are then filtered by source deployment,
topology visibility, coherent missingness, source timing/batching, and only then rendered.

`OBSERVATION_MANIFEST.json` records aggregate source-observation outcomes. When exact source
overrides are part of the effective scenario, `source_deployment_digest` binds those diagnostics to
the immutable compiled deployment. `COLLECTION_PROFILE.json` records the primary collection window,
observation profile, family tail policy, and export ordering. Projection envelopes themselves are
ephemeral; the bundle does not retain one decision object per candidate record.

When diagnosing absence, distinguish an undeployed source, missing capability, invisible topology,
coherent drop/filter, and an out-of-window record. Do not change scenario collection policy to hide
a lifecycle, effect, content, channel, or timing defect.

## Output Targets

`eforge generate --target default|sof-elk|splunk` selects one rendering for the run. It changes
paths or record shapes under `data/`; it does not create a target-named bundle root. Scenario
`output.logs` and `--formats` continue to use canonical format names.

| Family | `default` | `sof-elk` | `splunk` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows Security | Rooted `<host>/windows_event_security.xml` | `<host>/<year>/windows_event_security_snare.log` | `<host>/windows_event_security.xml`, one complete Event per line |
| Windows Sysmon | Rooted `<host>/windows_event_sysmon.xml` | `<host>/<year>/windows_event_sysmon_snare.log` | `<host>/windows_event_sysmon.xml`, one complete Event per line |
| Linux syslog | `<host>/syslog.log`, RFC5424 | `<host>/<year>/syslog.log`, RFC3164/BSD | `<host>/syslog.log`, RFC5424 |
| Cisco ASA | `<firewall>/cisco_asa.log` | `<firewall>/<year>/cisco_asa.log` | `<firewall>/cisco_asa.log` |
| Web access | Combined text | Combined text | Apache TA-compatible JSON in `web_access.log` |
| Proxy access | Extended combined text | Plain combined text | Apache TA-compatible proxy JSON with CIM tagging in `proxy_access.log` |
| Zeek, IDS, eCAR, bash | Source-native files | Unchanged | Unchanged |

`OUTPUT_TARGET.txt` contains the chosen target. A missing marker identifies legacy/default output
to evaluation. `COLLECTION_PROFILE.json` does not disclose storyline labels or truth.

`STORAGE_MANIFEST.json` schema version 3 keeps unique host file sets, alias share bindings, platform,
native roots/filesystems, audit policy, mappings, credential mode, and non-secret principal identity.
Storyline targets separate wire/share-relative, client-presented, and server-local paths. The
manifest never contains credential secrets or file payloads.

## Checkpoint workspace, replacement, and verification

Fresh runs checkpoint every 24 hours unless `--checkpoint-hours 0` is passed. Resume needs
`--resume`; checkpoint-only resume also needs explicit `--output`. Compatible resume may attempt
environment drift, but run identity, state schemas, integrity, and fresh OOB authorization remain
hard boundaries. Move only a stopped root; success removes `.eforge-generation/`.
Use `eforge checkpoint status <root> [--verbose|--json]` for static inspection and `checkpoint
verify` for isolated hydration. Non-exact resume migrates at the same cursor and retains fallback.
Provenance records builds, runtime drift, behavior risk/change IDs, policy, confirmation, and cursor.
`eforge checkpoint suspend <root>` queues a request; generation finishes the current hour, commits
an off-cadence recovery, then stops. First Ctrl+C uses the same safe boundary; a second forces exit.

An approved `--overwrite` run replaces engine-owned data, reports, manifests, generated artifacts,
and resolved scenario as one unit. `--force` / `-f` is a deprecated alias. A format-filtered overwrite
still replaces the entire `data/` directory; it does not retain formats from an older run.
Unregistered authored collateral is preserved.

After exit code 0, report effective manifest values. Use `eforge eval <bundle-root>` for independent
containment/hash verification. Timestamped run manifests need not be byte-identical across replays.
