# How to Contribute

Thanks for your interest in contributing to EvidenceForge! Here are a few
general guidelines on contributing and reporting bugs that we ask you to review.
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the
contributors managing and developing this open source project. In return, they
should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and
helping you finalize your pull requests. In that spirit of mutual respect, we
endeavor to review incoming issues and pull requests within 10 days, and will
close any lingering issues or pull requests after 60 days of inactivity.

Please note that all of your interactions in the project are subject to our
[Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This includes creation of issues or pull
requests, commenting on issues or pull requests, and extends to all interactions
in any real-time space e.g., Slack, Discord, etc.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting a new issue, please ensure that the issue was not already
reported or fixed by searching through our [issues
list](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/EvidenceForge/issues).

When creating a new issue, please be sure to include a **title and clear
description**, as much relevant information as possible, and, if possible, a
test case.

**If you discover a security bug, please do not report it through GitHub.
Instead, please see security procedures in [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md).**

## Suggesting Features

Feature requests are welcome! Open a GitHub Issue with the **enhancement** label
and include:

- A clear description of the feature and the problem it solves
- Example usage or scenario where the feature would be helpful
- Any relevant references (e.g., log format specs, MITRE ATT&CK techniques)

## Sending Pull Requests

Before sending a new pull request, take a look at existing pull requests and
issues to see if the proposed change or fix has been discussed in the past, or
if the change was already implemented but not yet released.

We expect new pull requests to include tests for any affected behavior, and, as
we follow semantic versioning, we may reserve breaking changes until the next
major version release.

Before submitting a regular feature or fix pull request, install development
dependencies and run the normal suite without coverage instrumentation plus
lint/format checks:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

Run the extended release gate without coverage when your change touches
generation behavior or before a release PR:

```bash
uv run pytest -m slow --no-cov --durations=20
```

Million-entry, multi-week, exhaustive-matrix, and full-demo diagnostics are
not release gates. Run only the soak tests relevant to the changed owner:

```bash
uv run pytest -m soak --no-cov --durations=20
```

Run optional third-party parser validation when touching emitted log formats
covered by an external parser harness. This lane requires Docker Compose v2 or
Podman Compose:

```bash
uv run pytest --include-external-parsers -m external_parser --no-cov
```

See [External Parser Validation](docs/external-parser-validation/README.md)
for the full-dataset runner command, SOF-ELK® harness architecture, coverage
matrix, ignored-tag policy, and failure report details.

If you add or change a log format that already has external parser support,
update the external-parser smoke lane for that format and run it. If you add a
new supported parser family, include discovery, staging, representative smoke
fixtures, validation checks, docs coverage, and any explicit tag-policy rules.
If there is no applicable third-party parser yet, update the coverage matrix
and keep discovery warnings/tests in place so the unsupported format is not
silently skipped.

For target-dependent parser support, add or update smoke fixtures for the
target that the parser expects. SOF-ELK checks for Windows/Sysmon, Linux syslog,
and Cisco ASA use `eforge generate --target sof-elk`; default-target output
must still be covered by normal generation/evaluation tests and should produce a
clear diagnostic in the external-parser runner. The developer-facing SOF-ELK
script requires `OUTPUT_TARGET.txt` to exist and contain `sof-elk`; legacy or
default-target datasets exit before parser discovery/staging.

Coverage is reserved for final readiness checks before opening a `dev` → `main`
release PR. Do not combine slow tests with coverage during release validation:
slow tests are intentionally run with `--no-cov`, and coverage is measured on
the default non-slow suite.

```bash
uv run pytest --cov=evidenceforge --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=70
```

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Prefix
your commit message with a type:

- `feat:` — new feature or capability
- `fix:` — bug fix
- `docs:` — documentation changes
- `test:` — adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` — code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `chore:` — maintenance tasks (dependencies, CI, tooling)

Examples:
```
feat: add SMTP log emitter
fix: correct Zeek UID correlation for DNS queries
docs: update scenario reference with dhcp_lease event type
test: add integration tests for proxy emitter
```

### Pull Request Descriptions

Describe what changed and why. Reference any related issues (e.g.,
`Closes #42`). If the change affects log output or scenario schema, include
a brief example of the before/after behavior.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/EvidenceForge.git
cd EvidenceForge

# Install dependencies and development tools (requires uv: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
uv sync --all-extras

# Run the routine test tier (coverage is opt-in)
uv run pytest

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
```

### Test Markers

- `@pytest.mark.slow`: extended release-gate tests, excluded by default and run with
  `uv run pytest -m slow --no-cov`. This lane holds distinct expensive fault matrices,
  fresh-process determinism checks, and representative end-to-end generation.
- `@pytest.mark.soak`: exceptional million-entry, multi-week, exhaustive-matrix, or full-demo
  diagnostics,
  excluded by routine and release gates. Run only when relevant with
  `uv run pytest -m soak --no-cov`. Slow and soak are mutually exclusive tiers.
- `@pytest.mark.external_parser`: third-party parser container tests, skipped by default
  and normally run only in an explicitly opted-in local or CI lane

```bash
# Normal fast run
uv run pytest

# Slow comprehensive run
uv run pytest -m slow --no-cov --durations=20

# External parser run
uv run pytest --include-external-parsers -m external_parser --no-cov

# Release coverage gate; do not combine with -m slow or -m soak
uv run pytest --cov=evidenceforge --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-fail-under=70
```

## Code Style

EvidenceForge follows strict coding conventions documented in [AGENTS.md](/AGENTS.md). Key points:

- **Type hints everywhere** — all functions, methods, and variables
- **Pydantic v2** for all structured data
- **100 character** line length, **4 space** indentation, **double quotes**
- **Google-style docstrings** for public functions
- **`uv`** for all dependency management (never `pip`)
- **`pathlib.Path`** for all path handling (never string paths)

Linting is enforced via `ruff` with pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, pep8-naming, pyupgrade, and flake8-bugbear rules.

## Adding a New Log Format

1. Create a format definition YAML in `src/evidenceforge/formats/definitions/`
2. Create an emitter class in `src/evidenceforge/generation/emitters/` inheriting from `LogEmitter`
3. Register the emitter in `src/evidenceforge/generation/emitters/__init__.py`
4. Add emitter initialization in the engine (`src/evidenceforge/generation/engine/emitter_setup.py`)
5. Create a parser in `src/evidenceforge/evaluation/parsers/` for eval support
6. Add tests for the emitter and parser
7. Document the format in `docs/reference/EVIDENCE_FORMATS.md`

## Adding a New Event Type

1. Add the event spec Pydantic model to `src/evidenceforge/models/scenario.py`
2. Add a handler in `ActivityGenerator` (`src/evidenceforge/generation/activity/generator.py`)
3. Add any needed context fields to `src/evidenceforge/events/contexts.py`
4. Implement `_render_{event_type}()` on relevant emitters
5. Update `src/evidenceforge/validation/schema.py` for cross-reference validation
6. Update `docs/reference/scenario-reference.md`
7. Add tests

Thanks again for your interest in contributing to EvidenceForge!

### Native Windows CI

Routine CI runs Python 3.12 on Ubuntu and native Windows, with `uv run pytest --no-cov`.
The routine suite includes a short real generation, checkpoint, cooperative suspension,
verification, and fresh-process resume comparison against uninterrupted output. The same test
runs during normal local macOS testing. Broad checkpoint fault/interruption tests remain in the
Linux slow release gate for PRs into main.

Native Windows uses an isolated local NTFS backend for protected output journals and checkpoints;
macOS and Linux retain their POSIX implementations. The routine timeout is 45 minutes on Windows
and 25 minutes on Linux. Small native API contracts run in the routine suite. A separate required
Windows checkpoint durability job runs focused slow simulated power-loss recovery tests with a
20-minute timeout. These tests validate the documented storage assumptions, not physical power-loss
certification. See the
[native Windows design](docs/design/native-windows-filesystem.md) for platform limits. Do not
blanket-skip portable failures or disable publication protections to make the job green.
